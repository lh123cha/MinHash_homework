CCTV: A report released recently by the National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that China is the world’s top annual contributor to global economic growth over the past decade or so. With rising instability and uncertainties in the global economic landscape and particularly under the impact of COVID-19, China’s sustained and steady growth contributes to the recovery of the world economy. I wonder if you could share more information on this?

Mao Ning: China’s economy registered an average annual growth rate of 6.6% for the past decade or so, leading major economies and much higher than the global average of 2.6% and the 3.7% for developing economies over the same period. China contributed up to 38.6% on average to world economic growth, more than the G7 countries combined. In 2021, China remained the world’s second largest economy and largest trading country, with its GDP accounting for 18.5% of the world economic aggregate and its foreign trade hitting $6.9 trillion, up by 7.2 percentage points and 56.8% respectively from a decade earlier.

The fundamentals sustaining China’s sound economic growth in the long run remain unchanged. China remains committed to opening-up. We will continue to uphold the principle of openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit and win-win results, expand high-level opening-up, share development dividends with the world and contribute more to the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy.

TASS: A blast rocked the Crimean Bridge yesterday, causing a fire. The incident left three people dead and damaged and collapsed part of the roadway on the bridge. Later, Advisor to the Head of the Office of the Ukrainian President Mikhail Podoliak noted that “Crimea, the bridge, the beginning”. Do you have any comment on this?

Mao Ning: We have taken note of relevant reports.



Reuters: So I know you answered a question about this yesterday, but earlier today, North Korea fired yet another two ballistic missiles, and this is the 7th such launch by Pyongyang in recent days. So I was just wondering if the foreign ministry have any comment on today’s missile launches and whether it is concerned about the frequency of such actions in recent days?

Mao Ning: We noted relevant reports. We also noted the continuous joint military exercises by the US, Japan and the ROK around the Korean Peninsula and the remarks of the DPRK’s Ministry of National Defense on October 8 in response to the exercises. We hope parties concerned will stay committed to seeking a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue and address each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation. The US side needs to keep its word and act on its statement that it has no hostile intent toward the DPRK and create conditions for the resumption of meaningful dialogue.

Associated Press of Pakistan: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a recent statement said we are deeply obliged to the CPC, the Chinese government, the Red Cross Society of China and the PLA for continuing assistance to flood victims in Pakistan. Do you have any comment on that?

Mao Ning: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks speak to the friendship between China and Pakistan. After Pakistan was hit by the floods, China responded immediately. Chinese leaders sent messages of sympathy to Pakistani leaders. The Chinese government and people, feeling deeply for our ironclad Pakistani friends in the affected areas, have been providing disaster relief assistance based on the situation on the ground and Pakistan’s needs. We launched a rapid, massive and strong relief effort and provided whole-of-government, whole-of-society and all-dimensional assistance. It has been proven time and again that China and Pakistan are true friends and good brothers sharing weal and woe. The friendship between our two peoples has stood the test of international vicissitudes and time and become a valued asset for both sides.

At present, China and Pakistan are working closely together on the delivery of relief supplies into the hands of the people in need and post-disaster reconstruction. We believe the Pakistani people will prevail over the floods at an early date and the brotherly friendship between our two countries will be further elevated.



China News Service: According to reports, the US, citing the situation in Iran, has recently sanctioned Iranian officials pursuant to its domestic law and threatened to continue imposing sanctions on Iran. The Iranian side has accused the US of inciting confrontation in Iran. What’s China’s comment?

Mao Ning: China is opposed to the US’s illegal unilateral sanctions on Iran. We are against interference in countries’ internal affairs under any pretext and against instigation of color revolutions in countries in the name of democracy and human rights.

Reuters: Has China been in communication with North Korea about the recent missile launches?

Mao Ning: China maintains communication with all parties concerned. We hope relevant parties will address each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation and create conditions for the resumption of meaningful dialogue. 



CCTV: Tesla’s founder Elon Musk drew wide attention yesterday with his remarks on Taiwan. You also shared China’s position as the spokesperson. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said Musk’s comments are unacceptable. Do you have any further comment? 

Mao Ning: Yesterday I shared China’s principled position on the Taiwan question. The root cause of the current tensions across the Taiwan Strait is that the DPP authorities have been acting with external forces to make provocations and seek independence. Only by resolutely deterring “Taiwan independence” separatism and opposing external interference can peace and stability be ensured in the Taiwan Strait.

I want to stress that peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems is the basic principle for resolving the Taiwan question and the best way to realize national reunification. Provided that national sovereignty, security and development interests are ensured, Taiwan can adopt a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region, Taiwan’s social system and its way of life will be fully respected and the lawful rights and interests of our Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected. China’s reunification will not undermine any country’s legitimate interests. Instead, it will only bring more development opportunities to other countries and inject more positive energy into the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. We welcome and hope to see understanding and support from more and more people for China’s peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems. 

The remarks you mentioned from the DPP authorities have no merit. Whatever the DPP authorities say, they cannot change the basic fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory.
