10.08 MASTV: Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying recently posted 13 pictures on social media featuring landmark infrastructure projects printed on the banknotes of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Algeria, Malawi, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Qatar, Kuwait and Tajikistan. All the projects are built by China. Can you tell us more on that?Mao Ning: The tweets you mentioned posted by Assistant Foreign Minister Hua Chunying have indeed attracted wide attention and received many thumbs-ups for “built by China”. The infrastructure printed on those banknotes include ports, bridges, power stations, mosques, parliament buildings, stadiums and libraries. They are well-known name cards of “built by China” and shining examples of China’s cooperation with fellow developing countries.As the largest developing country in the world, China has always been committed to supporting and helping other developing countries in improving people’s livelihood and growing their economies. China has made tangible contributions to the economic and social development of these countries, which have been welcomed by the local people. By taking these concrete actions, China is honoring its commitment of always standing together with fellow developing countries.We are also truly happy to see that recently, some key cooperation projects between China and other developing countries have made fresh progress. The Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway connecting Cambodia’s capital and Sihanoukville started trial use on October 1. The expressway, the first of its kind in Cambodia, is a key project of its Belt and Road cooperation with China and marks the beginning of the age of expressway for Cambodia. A ceremony was recently held for the inauguration of the Jazan City for Primary and Downstream Industries Port (JCPDI Port), which is the first port designed, constructed and partially operated by Chinese companies in Saudi Arabia. It is expected to facilitate the socioeconomic development of Jazan Province and the Southwest part of Saudi Arabia. On October 6, the Velana International Airport in Maldives launched the first Code-4F runway and a modern seaplane terminal, which meet the takeoff and landing requirements of large planes like Airbus A380 and will notably improve the airport’s ability of receiving tourists. It is a landmark project of China-Maldives Belt and Road cooperation. With more progress expected under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative, China will deliver even more tangible benefits for the developing countries. We are sure that more such good news is still to come.Reuters: Tesla founder Elon Musk in an interview with Financial Times suggested that a reasonably palatable solution to cross-Strait tensions would be for China to make Taiwan into a special administrative zone. How do you comment about this?Mao Ning: The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair. China’s position on resolving the Taiwan question is consistent and clear. We remain committed to the basic principle of peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems and aim to work with the greatest sincerity and effort to achieve peaceful reunification. At the same time, we will resolutely defeat attempts to pursue the “Taiwan independence” separatist agenda, push back interference by external forces, and safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.China Review News: Recently, the US Foreign Policy Association released a report titled The Business of America and China Is Business, calling on US policymakers to re-calibrate their mistaken assumptions and policy toward China, view China from a correct perspective and strengthen US-China economic and trade cooperation. Do you have any comment on this?Mao Ning: I have read this report too and I am impressed by some of its observations. For example, the report essentially argues that China and the US have close economic and trade ties and US companies’ trust in China as an investment destination is increasing; China is an important business opportunity for the US and US tariffs levied on Chinese imports have hurt the US more than they have hurt China; and only when the US views China in an objective light can it formulate the right China policy and foreign policy.The business and academic communities in the US have been calling for strengthening China-US cooperation recently. Institutions including the US-China Business Council and AmCham China said that it’s important to cooperate with rather than decouple from China, and that the US government needs to lower tariffs on China as soon as possible. According to statistics, the average return on US direct investment in China was 14.7% between 2000 and 2020, far higher than that of US outbound direct investment of 9.7%. In the first half of this year, China-US trade grew by 12.7% and the US paid-in investment in China increased by 26.1% year-on-year. This fully shows that the Chinese and American peoples aspire for cooperation and that China-US cooperation can deliver mutual benefits.US policymakers need to listen more to the rational and objective voices of the business and academic communities, stop handling China-US relations with the outdated mindset of zero-sum games, stop letting its China policy be guided by the so-called “political correctness”, seriously uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and bring China-US relations back onto the track of sound and steady development.Shenzhen TV: According to reports, in recent years, the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO), which runs the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, has been exaggerating the safety of treated nuclear-contaminated water to visitors using a dosimeter that fails to detect radioactive tritium and only responds to highly concentrated cesium above a certain level. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: We have noted relevant reports. TEPCO is known to have previously falsified data and covered up safety issues in the operation of the nuclear power plant. The international community has long held serious concerns over the legitimacy of Japan’s proposal to discharge the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, the reliability of its data, the effectiveness of the treatment system and the uncertainties about the environmental impact.The potential harm of nuclear-contaminated water discharge to the marine environment, food safety and public health cannot be overlooked. It bears not only on the Japanese people’s basic human rights such as the right to health, but also on the rights and interests of all those living along the coasts of the Pacific Ocean.We once again urge Japan to take seriously the legitimate and justified concerns of the international community and its own people and to have full consultation with stakeholders including neighboring countries and relevant international agencies. It must stop trying to push through the ocean discharge plan and instead dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a truly science-based, open, transparent and safe manner.Yonhap News Agency: Recently, the DPRK has fired several ballistic missiles. It also denounced today the joint military exercises held by the ROK and the US. Do you have any comment on that?Mao Ning: We noted relevant reports. We have also noted that the ROK and the US have recently held another joint military exercise. We hope parties concerned will stay committed to seeking a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue and resolving each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation. Given the delicate and complex situation on the Korean Peninsula, we hope relevant parties will refrain from moves or rhetoric that may be perceived as provocative and create conditions for the resumption of dialogue.Hubei Media Group: It is reported that 38 people including more than 20 preschoolers were killed and many others were injured in a serious shooting at a daycare center in Thailand’s northeastern province of Nong Bua Lam Phu on October 6. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: We are shocked by the tragic shooting incident in Nong Bua Lam Phu Province of Thailand. We are deeply saddened by the loss of lives and express sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured.AFP: The US Department of Commerce has just announced new export controls on chips intended to stop China from acquiring sensitive technologies. This comes after the US blacklisted 13 more Chinese companies on Thursday, including DJI. Do you have any response to these decisions?Mao Ning: In order to maintain its sci-tech hegemony, the US has been abusing export control measures to wantonly block and hobble Chinese enterprises. Such practice runs counter to the principle of fair competition and international trade rules. It will not only harm Chinese companies’ legitimate rights and interests, but also hurt the interests of US companies. It will hinder international sci-tech exchange and trade cooperation, and deal a blow to global industrial and supply chains and world economic recovery. By politicizing tech and trade issues and using them as a tool and weapon, the US cannot hold back China’s development but will only hurt and isolate itself when its action backfires.The Hindu: This is the question on the UNHRC vote on Xinjiang, which I know that the foreign ministry already issued a response too. So India was among the countries that did not support the vote and abstained on it. At the same time yesterday, India’s foreign ministry said that the human rights of people in Xinjiang should be respected, and India hopes that the relevant party will address the situation objectively and properly. I was just wondering if you have a comment on that.Mao Ning: I have noted relevant reports. I want to stress that the issues related to Xinjiang are not about human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism. Thanks to strenuous efforts, there has been no violent terrorist incident in Xinjiang for over five consecutive years. The human rights of people of all ethnic backgrounds in Xinjiang are protected to the greatest extent possible. The voting result at the Human Rights Council reflects the position of the international community, especially developing countries, of firmly rejecting the politicization of human rights issues. This once again shows that truth will always prevail and the attempt to use Xinjiang-related issues to suppress and contain China will not succeed.Phoenix TV: According to new analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), Chinese diplomats have been running a disinformation campaign in Solomon Islands. They have successfully convinced Solomon Islands outlets to republish Chinese government press releases and state media pieces and tried to shape public opinion. The ASPI report found that negative comments about China dropped from 49% of the total to 29% during this campaign, while positive comments about Beijing jumped sharply, from just 8% of the total to 41%. Critical comments about the West bounced up, from zero to 18%. What’s your comment?Mao Ning: Since China and Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations three years ago, the Chinese side has vigorously promoted friendly exchanges and practical cooperation with Solomon Islands in various sectors guided by the principle of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, openness and inclusiveness. This has yielded tangible and fruitful outcomes and delivered concrete benefits to the local people. This is the fundamental reason why people in Solomon Islands have developed a more positive and appreciative view of China and why friendship has been deepening between our two countries.In Solomon Islands and other Pacific Island Countries, people think highly of China because we have delivered for their countries. The people there know it best and their recognition means more than anyone else’s. People can tell who exactly is running a disinformation campaign, and who is genuinely contributing to island countries’ development. Those who deliberately seek to sow discord with false narratives will achieve nothing.CGTN: Recently, Burkina Faso saw the second coup this year. A group of military officers ousted the transitional president and dissolved the government and the interim parliament. They also plan to hold a national conference to elect a new transitional president. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: We are closely following the developments in Burkina Faso. We note its announcement that Burkina Faso will continue to observe the transition timeline that was previously agreed upon with the Economic Community of West African States. China respects the independent choices of the people of Burkina Faso and believes that they are capable of handling their internal affairs and keeping the country peaceful and stable. China is ready to work with the international community to play a constructive role in Burkina Faso’s efforts to achieve stability and development.Beijing Youth Daily: Earlier this month, the 101st session of the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) reviewed and approved the destruction plan beyond the year 2022 for the chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: Japan’s abandoned chemical weapons (ACWs) are one of the serious crimes committed by Japanese militarists during their war of aggression against China. The ACWs have long been a serious threat to people’s lives and property and ecological environment in the relevant areas in China. China has been urging Japan to completely and thoroughly destroy its ACWs in China as soon as possible in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the memorandums between the two governments. Japan missed the deadlines for the relevant destruction plan three times already and will soon miss the deadline for the fourth time. The way Japan is fulfilling its commitments is not satisfactory for people in both countries and the international community.The OPCW held the 101st session of the Executive Council from October 4 to 7, during which it reviewed and approved the destruction plan beyond the year 2022 for the chemical weapons abandoned by Japan in China jointly submitted by China and Japan. This shows that the international community attaches importance to and supports the handling of Japan’s ACWs. China appreciates this. China strongly urges Japan to fulfill its political and legal commitments to the international community and China, implement the new destruction plan in a comprehensive, complete and faithful manner, and act in accordance with the CWC and inter-governmental memorandums to mobilize resources and increase input in an effort to move ahead the destruction process and completely and thoroughly eliminate the harm of ACWs as soon as possible.
10.09 CCTV: A report released recently by the National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that China is the world’s top annual contributor to global economic growth over the past decade or so. With rising instability and uncertainties in the global economic landscape and particularly under the impact of COVID-19, China’s sustained and steady growth contributes to the recovery of the world economy. I wonder if you could share more information on this?Mao Ning: China’s economy registered an average annual growth rate of 6.6% for the past decade or so, leading major economies and much higher than the global average of 2.6% and the 3.7% for developing economies over the same period. China contributed up to 38.6% on average to world economic growth, more than the G7 countries combined. In 2021, China remained the world’s second largest economy and largest trading country, with its GDP accounting for 18.5% of the world economic aggregate and its foreign trade hitting $6.9 trillion, up by 7.2 percentage points and 56.8% respectively from a decade earlier.The fundamentals sustaining China’s sound economic growth in the long run remain unchanged. China remains committed to opening-up. We will continue to uphold the principle of openness, inclusiveness, mutual benefit and win-win results, expand high-level opening-up, share development dividends with the world and contribute more to the strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy.TASS: A blast rocked the Crimean Bridge yesterday, causing a fire. The incident left three people dead and damaged and collapsed part of the roadway on the bridge. Later, Advisor to the Head of the Office of the Ukrainian President Mikhail Podoliak noted that “Crimea, the bridge, the beginning”. Do you have any comment on this?Mao Ning: We have taken note of relevant reports.Reuters: So I know you answered a question about this yesterday, but earlier today, North Korea fired yet another two ballistic missiles, and this is the 7th such launch by Pyongyang in recent days. So I was just wondering if the foreign ministry have any comment on today’s missile launches and whether it is concerned about the frequency of such actions in recent days?Mao Ning: We noted relevant reports. We also noted the continuous joint military exercises by the US, Japan and the ROK around the Korean Peninsula and the remarks of the DPRK’s Ministry of National Defense on October 8 in response to the exercises. We hope parties concerned will stay committed to seeking a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue and address each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation. The US side needs to keep its word and act on its statement that it has no hostile intent toward the DPRK and create conditions for the resumption of meaningful dialogue.Associated Press of Pakistan: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a recent statement said we are deeply obliged to the CPC, the Chinese government, the Red Cross Society of China and the PLA for continuing assistance to flood victims in Pakistan. Do you have any comment on that?Mao Ning: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks speak to the friendship between China and Pakistan. After Pakistan was hit by the floods, China responded immediately. Chinese leaders sent messages of sympathy to Pakistani leaders. The Chinese government and people, feeling deeply for our ironclad Pakistani friends in the affected areas, have been providing disaster relief assistance based on the situation on the ground and Pakistan’s needs. We launched a rapid, massive and strong relief effort and provided whole-of-government, whole-of-society and all-dimensional assistance. It has been proven time and again that China and Pakistan are true friends and good brothers sharing weal and woe. The friendship between our two peoples has stood the test of international vicissitudes and time and become a valued asset for both sides.At present, China and Pakistan are working closely together on the delivery of relief supplies into the hands of the people in need and post-disaster reconstruction. We believe the Pakistani people will prevail over the floods at an early date and the brotherly friendship between our two countries will be further elevated.China News Service: According to reports, the US, citing the situation in Iran, has recently sanctioned Iranian officials pursuant to its domestic law and threatened to continue imposing sanctions on Iran. The Iranian side has accused the US of inciting confrontation in Iran. What’s China’s comment?Mao Ning: China is opposed to the US’s illegal unilateral sanctions on Iran. We are against interference in countries’ internal affairs under any pretext and against instigation of color revolutions in countries in the name of democracy and human rights.Reuters: Has China been in communication with North Korea about the recent missile launches?Mao Ning: China maintains communication with all parties concerned. We hope relevant parties will address each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation and create conditions for the resumption of meaningful dialogue.CCTV: Tesla’s founder Elon Musk drew wide attention yesterday with his remarks on Taiwan. You also shared China’s position as the spokesperson. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said Musk’s comments are unacceptable. Do you have any further comment?Mao Ning: Yesterday I shared China’s principled position on the Taiwan question. The root cause of the current tensions across the Taiwan Strait is that the DPP authorities have been acting with external forces to make provocations and seek independence. Only by resolutely deterring “Taiwan independence” separatism and opposing external interference can peace and stability be ensured in the Taiwan Strait.I want to stress that peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems is the basic principle for resolving the Taiwan question and the best way to realize national reunification. Provided that national sovereignty, security and development interests are ensured, Taiwan can adopt a high degree of autonomy as a special administrative region, Taiwan’s social system and its way of life will be fully respected and the lawful rights and interests of our Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected. China’s reunification will not undermine any country’s legitimate interests. Instead, it will only bring more development opportunities to other countries and inject more positive energy into the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. We welcome and hope to see understanding and support from more and more people for China’s peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems.The remarks you mentioned from the DPP authorities have no merit. Whatever the DPP authorities say, they cannot change the basic fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory.
10.10 Associated Press of Pakistan：According to a report, the energy projects completed under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor have generated so far over 46,000 jobs in Pakistan. I wonder if you have any comment on that?Mao Ning: I noted the relevant information and the report. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a key pilot project under the Belt and Road Initiative and a landmark project of China-Pakistan cooperation in the new era. Energy is one of the areas with the largest investment, fastest progress and most productive cooperation under CPEC. Our energy cooperation has not only provided Pakistan with clean, stable and high-quality energy for the local economic and social development, but also created a large number of jobs for Pakistan and helped train many talents in the construction, operation and management of various energy projects. This has been highly commended by the Pakistani government and various sectors.China is ready to work with Pakistan to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and make CPEC a demonstration project of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation so as to deliver greater benefits to the people of the two countries and other countries in the region.Reuters: Massive explosions shook the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and other cities in Ukraine this morning in apparent Russian revenge strikes after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared an explosion on the bridge linking Crimea to Russia to be a terrorist attack. What’s China’s comment?Mao Ning: We noted relevant reports. We hope the situation will deescalate as soon as possible.The Paper: A recent report released by the US CDC shows that firearm homicide and suicide rates were more than 8% higher in 2021 than they were in 2020, the highest since the early 1990s. What is your comment on this?Mao Ning: We have noted the report. We also noted that according to the statistics from Gun Violence Archive, till September 26, 500 mass shootings have taken place this year in the US, in each of which four or more people were killed or injured. Since late September, the US has continued to witness shootings in Texas, Maryland and Arizona.The report also mentioned that African American people continue to experience the highest firearm homicide rates for every age. Previously, a CDC report showed that African Americans are 12 times more likely to be shot than White Americans. Gun violence, compounded by systemic racism, has taken a significant toll on racial minorities.The right to life is the most important human right. Whether the US will effectively contain gun violence and seriously protect the right of ethnic minorities is a key yardstick for the international community to measure the US-style democracy and approach to human rights.Reuters: So just to follow up on the question I just asked about the situation in Ukraine. You just said China hopes the situation will deescalate soon. Is China at all concerned about what’s happening at the moment, in particular these explosions today reported across Ukraine?Mao Ning: We’ve made clear our position on the Ukraine issue on multiple occasions. We believe that all countries deserve respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed, that the legitimate security concerns of any country should be taken seriously, and that support should be given to all efforts that are conducive to peacefully resolving the crisis. We hope all parties will properly address their differences through dialogue and consultation. China stands ready to continue to play a constructive part in deescalation efforts.AFP: The DPRK leader said that the DPRK’s recent missile tests included tactical nuclear drills that simulate strikes against the ROK. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: We have noted relevant reports. We also noted the continuous large-scale joint military exercises by the US, Japan and the ROK. China’s position on the issues on the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged. We will continue to play a positive role in promoting the political settlement of these issues.Reuters: Just now, you said that China hopes all parties will play a constructive role in the deescalation effort. Does China believe that the reported array of attacks across Ukraine today are a sort of constructive effort with regard to creating deescalation by Russia?Mao Ning: I just made clear China’s position on the Ukraine issue. We believe that it’s important for all parties to engage in dialogue and negotiation and jointly work for the deescalation of the situation.Reuters: Is China in communications with Russia and Ukraine over the recent escalation in the situation there?Mao Ning: China maintains communication with all parties. We stand ready to play a constructive part in deescalation efforts.
9.13 China Daily: The Foreign Ministry put out an announcement yesterday that President Xi Jinping will attend the upcoming SCO summit in Uzbekistan and pay state visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Could you share more with us on the background of, considerations behind and expectations for these visits?Mao Ning: This will be China’s most important event of head-of-state diplomacy on the eve of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which shows the high importance China attaches to the SCO and our relations with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.The profound changes in the international landscape and the protracted COVID-19 pandemic have further underscored the role the SCO plays in upholding regional security and stability and promoting countries’ development and prosperity. At the upcoming SCO summit,President Xi Jinping will have in-depth exchanges of views with other participating leaders with a focus on all-dimensional SCO cooperation and major international and regional issues to build new common understandings and open a new chapter for cooperation. We are convinced that the SCO will continue to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit, stay true to its founding mission and work hard to achieve even more on the new journey ahead and make greater contributions to the cause of global and regional peace and development as the organization enters its third decade.Both Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are China’s friendly neighbors and comprehensive strategic partners, and important countries along the Belt and Road. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the two countries three decades ago, we have always followed the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborliness, friendship, mutual assistance, and win-win cooperation and advanced bilateral ties toward new heights. President Xi Jinping’s upcoming state visits will mark a new stage in China’s relations with the two countries.During the visit, President Xi Jinping will hold talks with Kazakh President Tokayev and Uzbek President Mirziyoyev. They will have in-depth exchanges on bilateral ties, cooperation in various fields and international and regional issues of mutual interest. We’re confident the visits will provide a new blueprint, new goals and new impetus for China’s ties with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.AFP: A question on President Xi Jinping’s state visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Will President Xi meet with President Putin or Prime Minister Modi?Mao Ning: Heads-of-state diplomacy is the most important political guarantee for China-Russia relations to make steady and sustained progress. For a long time, Chinese and Russian presidents have maintained close exchanges and conducted strategic communication through various means, keeping the bilateral relationship always in the right direction. As for your specific question, I have no information to offer at the moment. We will release information in a timely manner if there is any.The Paper: We have noted that China and Japan jointly held a seminar on the 50th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations yesterday. Could you give us more details?Mao Ning: On September 12, a seminar commemorating the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic relations was held in an online-plus-offline format. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi delivered video addresses respectively at the event, which was attended by representatives from all sectors from both countries.State Councilor Wang Yi said in his remarks that as bilateral relations enter the next 50 years, China and Japan need to cherish the commitment made when establishing diplomatic relations, draw lessons from history, move China-Japan relations along the right track of sound and steady development and create new dimensions and impetus for bilateral relations.State Councilor Wang Yi put forward a five-point perspective on building a China-Japan relationship in line with the demands of the new era. First, honor commitments and uphold the political foundation of China-Japan relations. Second, bear in mind the bigger picture and keep the development of the bilateral relations on the right track. Third, deepen cooperation to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results at a higher level. Fourth, strengthen guidance to shape up positive and friendly mutual understanding; Fifth, embrace the trend of the times and practice true multilateralism.State Councilor Wang Yi’s five-point perspective reflects the importance China attaches to and expectations for China-Japan relations. It shed light on the future course for the development of bilateral relations and has drawn warm responses from many sectors in both countries. Looking ahead toward the next 50 years of China-Japan relations, China is ready to work with Japan to achieve positive results in bilateral relations, bring more benefits to the two peoples and make greater contribution to peace and development of the region and the world at large.Hubei Media Group: A Formal Consultative Meeting of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) concluded in Geneva on September 9. Is there anything you could share about the meeting and how would you comment on the meeting?Mao Ning: At Russia’s request, a Formal Consultative Meeting of the BWC was held in Geneva from September 5 to 9. The meeting was held to review the US compliance with the BWC. The meeting was widely attended by states parties to the BWC, who viewed it as an important event.We have noted that Russia demonstrated a group of evidence and materials to support allegations that the US’s biological military activities constitute violations of the BWC, to which the US responded in defense. Other states parties including China raised multiple questions at the meeting that required clarification from the US. They also called for an early resumption of negotiations for a verification protocol to the BWC to fundamentally ensure the effective implementation of the Convention. Regrettably, the US side did not make a full and effective response to these allegations and questions and failed to address the concerns of the states parties. Going forward, the states parties will further look into and work on the issues related to US compliance.The US conducts more biological military activities than any other country in the world. It is also the only one that rejects negotiations for a verification protocol to the BWC. The international community has long had concerns about this. China supports continued objective and impartial reviews on issues related to US compliance in accordance with BWC provisions. We once again urge the US to give full clarifications on its biological military activities, stop being the only country that stands in the way of resuming negotiations for a verification protocol, and offer a responsible explanation to the international community.24kz: I have a question on President Xi Jinping’s visit to Kazakhstan. What is the visit mainly about? What does the visit mean for the China-Kazakhstan relationship and its future development?Mao Ning: We will release information on President Xi Jinping’s upcoming state visit to Kazakhstan in due course. Please follow our updates.Beijing Youth Daily: IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi presented to the Board of Governors a report on IAEA safeguards in relation to AUKUS on September 9, saying that the IAEA has conducted technical consultations with the US, the UK and Australia and he welcomes their engagement with the Agency to date and expect this to continue. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: We noted this latest report issued by the IAEA Director General on the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation. We believe this is a right step forward procedure-wise. In the meantime, we are gravely concerned about the substance of this report.This report lopsidedly cited the account given by the US, the UK and Australia to explain away what they have done, but made no mention of the international community’s major concerns over the risk of nuclear proliferation that may arise from the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation. The report turns a blind eye to many countries’ solemn position that the AUKUS cooperation violates the purpose and object of the NPT, and drew ultra vires, misleading conclusions on matters that should have been decided by member states through discussion.I need to stress that the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation can impact the integrity, efficacy and authority of the NPT. The safeguards and monitoring issues related to AUKUS will affect the interests of all member states of the IAEA and should be decided by all member states through discussion. China has therefore suggested that the IAEA launch a special committee open to all member states to have in-depth discussions on the political, legal and technical issues concerned and submit recommendations report to the IAEA Board of Governors and General Conference. Before consensus is reached by all parties, the US, the UK and Australia should not proceed with relevant cooperation, and the IAEA Secretariat should not have consultation with the three countries on the so-called safeguards and monitoring arrangement for their nuclear submarine cooperation.We urge the IAEA Secretariat to adopt an objective, neutral and professional position on the issue, fulfill its duty in strict accordance with its mandate, and provide a platform for discussing and addressing member states’ concerns over nuclear proliferation regarding the AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation. We also call on all IAEA member states to continue to have substantive discussions on AUKUS nuclear submarine cooperation through the inter-governmental process, take concrete actions to uphold the international non-proliferation system with the NPT as its cornerstone, and safeguard international peace and security.China News Service: The UN Office of Counter-Terrorism hosted the UN Global Congress of Victims of Terrorism at the UN headquarters in New York from September 8 to 9. Cheng Guoping, External Security Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led a delegation to the meeting. Can you give us more information on that?Mao Ning: China attaches great importance to protecting the rights of victims of terrorism. China sent a high-level delegation to that congress. In the remarks delivered at the event, the Chinese side put forward a four-point proposal, namely firmly combating all forms of terrorism, eradicating the breeding ground for terrorism, effectively addressing the root causes of terrorism and making every effort to help victims of terrorism. China called for active support to the Global Security Initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping, commitment to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and effort to build a world of lasting peace and common security. This was widely recognized.It is especially worth mentioning that Maimaitijiang, a victim of terrorism from China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, shared the story of her father’s heroic act as a police officer in the fight against terrorists, who gave his life for the cause. She also shared how the government looked after her family, which received a warm response at the meeting. Participants of the meeting expressed their understanding and support for the counter-terrorism campaign in Xinjiang. One representative came up to Maimaitijiang to say how moving her story was and how it helped grow the understanding of the counter-terrorism situation in Xinjiang and China’s efforts.Terrorism is a common enemy of humanity. China will continue to take an active part in international counter-terrorism cooperation, support the UN’s central, coordinating role, resolutely combat all forms of terrorism, earnestly protect the rights of victims of terrorism and make new contributions to the international counter-terrorism cause.Yonhap News Agency: The chronology of ancient Korea misses Goguryeo at the exhibition of Ancient Bronzes of China, Korea, and Japan at the National Museum of China. The ROK side said that Goguryeo is part of the history of the ROK and asked the Chinese side to make corrections accordingly and apologize. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: The Goguryeo issue is an academic issue. Views regarding academic issues can be shared and discussed in a professional way in the academic sphere. There is no need to hype it up politically.Shenzhen TV: After China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) and cybersecurity company 360 released investigation reports on the cyberattacks on Northwestern Polytechnical University from the US National Security Agency (NSA), relevant Chinese authorities today released a technical analysis report on the NSA’s cyberweapon “suctionchar”, drawing much media attention. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: Relevant Chinese authorities today released analysis on the US NSA’s attack on Northwestern Polytechnical University using the cyberweapon, which disclosed more details and evidence.China has asked the US via various channels to explain its malicious cyberattacks and immediately stop its unlawful behavior, but have yet to receive anything substantive from the US. I want to stress that the US behavior has seriously infringed on tech secrets of relevant Chinese institutions, and gravely undermined the security of China’s critical infrastructure, institutions and personal information. The US must immediately stop this and offer a responsible explanation.Reuters: According to a story published by Reuters, authorities at the Port of Hamburg are frustrated with the stance of the German government’s economic and foreign ministries who want to veto Chinese company COSCO’s acquisition of a 35% stake of the Tollerort container terminal. The Port of Hamburg authorities told Reuters they are concerned that if the deal is blocked, it could affect future Chinese investment in Germany. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Mao Ning: I’m not aware of what you mentioned. I would like to point out that the Chinese government always encourages Chinese businesses to conduct mutually-beneficial investment cooperation overseas in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. As a major trading country, Germany is deeply involved in economic globalization and international division of labor. It has the responsibility and obligation to keep the global industrial and supply chains stable. If what you said is true, we hope the German side will choose to remain committed to the principles of open market and fair competition, view Chinese investment in an objective and rational light, and provide a fair, open and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies, rather than politicize normal economic and trade cooperation, still less engage in protectionism in the name of national security.Macau Monthly: President Biden signed an executive order on September 12 to launch a national biotechnology and biomanufacturing initiative to reduce US dependence on foreign countries and ensure what’s invented in America is made in America in response to China’s challenge in biotechnology. What is your comment on this?Mao Ning: I would refer you to competent authorities for those specific questions. To give you our principled position, let me stress that economic globalization is the reality and a historic trend and we hope the US can respect the law of market economy and the principle of fair competition, instead of hampering global technological exchange and trade.Reuters: According to a Reuters report, the Biden administration plans next month to broaden curbs on US shipments to China of semiconductors used for artificial intelligence as well as chip-making tools. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on these latest potential measures?Mao Ning: What the US is doing is purely “sci-tech hegemony”. It seeks to use its technological prowess as an advantage to hobble and suppress the development of emerging markets and developing countries. While trumpeting a level playing field and a so-called “rules-based order”, the US cares only about “America first” and believes might makes right. The US probably hopes that China and the rest of the developing world will forever stay at the lower end of the industrial chain. This is not constructive.Reuters: Recently, the Ukrainian army’s counteroffensive has led to the withdrawal of Russian troops from a large swath of Ukrainian territory in what some analysts and government officials refer to as a turning point in this war. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on these recent developments? And can it say whether the Russian-Ukrainian conflict will be a topic of discussion in the upcoming SCO summit?Mao Ning: Our position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent. We call on parties concerned to realize a ceasefire through dialogue and negotiation and find a way to accommodate the legitimate security concerns of all parties concerned as soon as possible. Also, we hope the international community will create the conditions and space for that.
9.14 Xinhua News Agency: The 10,000th trip of the China-Europe Railway Express since the beginning of 2022 was made to Europe the other day, reaching the mark 10 days earlier than last year. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: The China-Europe Railway Express made its 10,000th trip this year sooner than last year despite the stress on the global supply chain and the global economic slowdown. This is indeed inspiring. The China-Europe Railway Express currently runs on 82 routes and reaches 200 cities in 24 European countries. The service is an accelerator for China-Europe trade and a boon for the socioeconomic development of countries and regions along the routes. It has also played an important role in stabilizing the global industrial and supply chains and promoting post-COVID world economic recovery.China and Europe are each other’s important trade and economic cooperation partners and key forces for shaping an open world economy. Despite COVID-19 and other complex factors, China-Europe trade and economic cooperation has shown strong resilience and dynamism. Bilateral trade hit a record high of $820 billion in 2021. The latest data from Eurostat shows that in the first half of 2022, trade between the 27 EU countries with China reached 413.9 billion euros, up by 28.3% year-on-year. These figures are evidence of the close economic ties and vast cooperation potential between China and Europe.In the face of increasingly complex international landscape, the world needs more bridges and roads rather than walls. China and Europe need to work together for development and prosperity and jointly advance international cooperation and human progress. That is where China-Europe relations should be headed.AFP: My question is still about President Xi Jinping’s state visits. Yesterday you didn’t disclose his agenda. Could you share some information today, especially on whether the flight taking the delegation to Central Asia has already taken off? When will they arrive in Kazakhstan? A Russian official said yesterday that President Xi will meet President Putin on Thursday. Can the foreign ministry confirm this?Mao Ning: Thank you for your interest in President Xi’s visits. We will release relevant information in due course. Please stay tuned.Phoenix TV: Canada’s Fraser Institute continued to rank Hong Kong at the top of 165 economies in the Economic Freedom of the World 2022 Annual Report it lately released. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: I have also taken note of the report you mentioned. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government welcomed the report in a statement. Since Hong Kong’s return to the motherland 25 years ago, with the full support of the Central Government, its economy has flourished, its status as an international financial, shipping and trading center has continued to be consolidated and its free, open and law-based business environment has been maintained. Hong Kong has been ranked among the freest and most competitive regions by multiple international institutions. This is a vote of confidence from the international community for the city’s unique advantages and bright prospects for development. Businesses from across the world are welcome to capitalize on this and come to Hong Kong to find the many business opportunities it has to offer and achieve greater success.Dragon TV: We noted that the 22nd China International Fair for Investment and Trade (CIFIT) was successfully held in recent days and achieved many important outcomes, which received high attention from the international community and unanimous praise from foreign participants. What is China’s expectation and outlook for further opening-up and cooperation in the future?Mao Ning: The 22nd China International Fair for Investment and Trade (CIFIT) concluded successfully recently. Under the theme of “Global Development: Sharing Digital Opportunities, Investing in Green Future”, the fair was participated online and offline by more than 800 business and trade groups, more than 4,000 companies and about 60,000 business people from over 90 countries and regions. Participants reached cooperation agreements on more than 480 projects with a total investment value of 342 billion yuan. The success of CIFIT once again demonstrates China’s positive attitude toward expanding opening-up and cooperation and integrating into the world.I wish to draw your attention to a highlight of this year’s fair — economic and trade cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). More than 60 events were held on Belt and Road international cooperation. Participants agreed that since the BRI was launched nine years ago, trade between China and participating countries has reached a new level and investment cooperation has made new progress. According to the General Administration of Customs of China, China’s imports and exports with BRI partner countries totaled 8.77 trillion yuan in the first eight months of this year, up by 20.2% year-on-year. This shows that high-quality Belt and Road cooperation not only improves infrastructure connectivity among countries, but also fosters a new platform for deepening global trade and investment.Going forward, China will continue to advance international economic and trade cooperation and promote global development and prosperity. China will open its door wider to the world.Bloomberg: A Taiwan-based outlet reported that Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang told US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman last month that China-US ties would “face disintegration” if the Taiwan Policy Act is passed. My question is, does that accurately characterize Ambassador Qin’s remarks?Mao Ning: I have no knowledge of what Ambassador Qin specifically said, but I believe he was stressing the importance of upholding the one-China principle to China-US relations. The Chinese side has repeatedly expressed its firm opposition to the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022. The one-China principle constitutes the political foundation of China-US relations. This principle is at the heart of the three China-US joint communiqués. The US side needs to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués and stop advancing the relevant Taiwan-related Act. Only by handling Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly can further damage be prevented to China-US relations.Global Times: It is reported that Russian President Putin appointed Morgulov Igor Vladimirovich, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, as the new Ambassador to China on September 13. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: China welcomes Russia’s appointment of a new Ambassador to China. We believe that Mr. Morgulov will play a key part in promoting friendship and mutual trust between the two peoples, and advancing cooperation between the two countries in various fields. We thank the outgoing Russian Ambassador to China Andrey Denisov for his contribution to the development of bilateral relations. We wish him all the best in all endeavors.China is ready to continue to work with Russia to follow through on the important common understandings between the two heads of state and keep bringing our comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era to new heights.Yonhap News Agency: Chairman Li Zhanshu will pay a friendly visit to the Republic of Korea (ROK) this week. I wonder if you could share the purpose and schedule of the visit.Mao Ning: At the invitation of the ROK’s National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin-pyo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Li Zhanshu will visit the ROK from September 15 to 17. This upcoming visit will be an important high-level exchange between China and the ROK amid COVID-19 and the first visit to the ROK by China’s Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress after seven years. During his visit, Chairman Li Zhanshu will meet with President Yoon Suk-yeol, have talks with Speaker Kim Jin-pyo, and have friendly exchanges with people from various sectors in the ROK. China looks forward to having in-depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest during the visit so as to further deepen the China-ROK strategic cooperative partnership.Reuters: I’d like to ask a question about a Reuters report that came out yesterday. So the United States is considering options for a sanctions package against China in order to deter it. And the European Union has come under diplomatic pressure from Taipei to do the same. This is according to sources familiar with these discussions. These are a response to fears which have grown as military tensions escalate in the Taiwan Strait. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Mao Ning: The root cause of the current tensions across the Taiwan Strait is that the one-China principle has been challenged and the DPP authorities keep pursuing the “Taiwan-independence” separatist agenda. The Taiwan question is purely China’s internal affair. No foreign country has the right to interfere in it. Let me stress that no country or individual should underestimate the Chinese government and people’s strong resolve and firm will to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity and to realize national reunification.AFP: Pope Francis of the Roman Catholic Church said yesterday when he arrived in Kazakhstan that he was willing to go to China at any time. Does China consider having talks with the Pope?Mao Ning: I have also noted relevant reports and appreciate the friendship and goodwill conveyed by Pope Francis. China and the Vatican maintain good communication. We are also ready to keep our dialogue and cooperation with the Vatican going and actively advance the process of improving relations.Reuters: This is another question regarding a Reuters report that also came out yesterday. Taiwan’s representative in Washington on Tuesday hosted international lawmakers in Washington who back sanctions on China if it continues to proceed with military drills around Taiwan. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Mao Ning: The one-China principle is the political foundation for the establishment and development of diplomatic relations between China and other countries. China firmly opposes any form of official exchanges between the Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China. Recently more than 170 countries and many international organizations have made their voice of justice heard. They reiterated their commitment to the one-China principle and expressed support for China’s efforts to firmly uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This once again shows that the one-China principle is a shared consensus of the international community.China opposes all foreign interference and never accepts any threat. The DPP authorities’ attempt to collude with external forces in pursuit of the “Taiwan-independence” separatist agenda will only lead to a dead end. Only by returning to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus can peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait be effectively ensured.Reuters: Does the foreign ministry plan on announcing whom it will send to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II?Mao Ning: China is actively considering sending a high-level delegation to the state funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. We will release the information in due course. Please check back for updates.
9.15 Han Zheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, will attend the opening ceremony of the 19th China-ASEAN Expo (CAEXPO) and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit (CABIS) on September 16.AFP: According to reports, President Xi Jinping will meet with President Vladimir Putin this afternoon. Can the foreign ministry share anything about the meeting? Will the two sides exchange views on the Ukraine crisis?Mao Ning: We will release information if there’s any. Please follow our updates.CCTV: President Xi Jinping made a state visit to Kazakhstan yesterday. Can you share more information on the visit?Mao Ning: At the invitation of President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of the Republic of Kazakhstan, President Xi Jinping made a state visit to Kazakhstan on September 14. President Tokayev received President Xi at the airport and held a warm welcome ceremony for him. The two Presidents toured an art exhibition titled “Kazakhstan-China: A Dialogue Across Millennium”. President Xi held formal talks with President Tokayev, attended the welcoming banquet, and received the Order of the Golden Eagle, the highest order of Kazakhstan, awarded by President Tokayev.President Xi’s visit is highly productive and fruitful. The two heads of state signed and issued the Joint Statement Between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Kazakhstan on the 30th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, and announced that China and Kazakhstan will work for the goal and vision of building a community with a shared future defined by lasting friendship, a high degree of mutual trust and sharing weal and woe. Relevant departments of the two sides signed bilateral cooperation documents in such areas as economy and trade, connectivity, finance, water conservancy and the media. The two sides also decided to set up consulates general in Xi’an and Aktobe respectively.Going forward, the two sides will continue to support each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests such as sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. The Kazakh side said it will continue to firmly support the one-China principle and oppose all forms of “Taiwan independence”.The two sides will fully leverage the important role of head-of-state diplomacy in providing strategic guidance and have regular strategic communication on major issues of common interest.The two sides will advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and seek synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and Kazakhstan’s new economic policy of the “Bright Road”Initiative.The two sides will actively follow the new vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, jointly combat terrorism, separatism and extremism, and uphold political security and the security of political authority.The two sides will firmly abide by the UN Charter and principles of international law, practice true multilateralism, expand cooperation under such multilateral frameworks as the UN and the SCO, implement the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind, and make our share of contribution to fostering a more equitable and reasonable global governance system.China is ready to work with Kazakhstan to follow the guidance of the important common understanding reached by the two Presidents during this visit, follow the spirit of mutual respect, good neighborliness, friendship, mutual assistance, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and move the China-Kazakhstan relationship into the next 30 golden years.The Paper: It is reported that on September 14 local time, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022, which now heads to the Senate floor. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: The bill seriously breaches the US’s commitment to China on the Taiwan question, and violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués. It constitutes an interference in China’s internal affairs, violates international law and basic norms in international relations, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. China is firmly opposed to this and has lodged serious démarches with the US side.There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. China will unswervingly advance the complete reunification of the country. No country, no force and no individual should ever misestimate the firm resolve, strong will and great capability of the Chinese Government and people to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity and to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation.The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-US relations and is at the core of the three China-US joint communiqués. If the bill continues to be deliberated, pushed forward or even become law, it will greatly shake the political foundation of China-US relations and cause extremely serious consequences to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.We strongly urge the US to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, earnestly act on the commitment made by the US leadership of not supporting “Taiwan independence”, stop playing the “Taiwan card” and using Taiwan to contain China, and stop advancing the deliberation of the relevant bill. China will take all necessary measures in light of the bill’s process and final outcome to firmly safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.Shenzhen TV: The US government announced on September 14 that the $3.5 billion of Afghan central bank reserves it had frozen will be transferred to a newly-established “Afghan Fund” in Switzerland. Wally Adeyemo, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, said no money would go to the Afghan central bank, until it is “free of political interference”. What’s China’s comment?Mao Ning: I noted relevant reports. These assets of the Afghan central bank frozen by the US are the national property of Afghanistan and the life-saving money of the Afghans. They should have been returned to Afghanistan in full at once, should have been handled independently by Afghanistan itself and should have been used to improve people’s livelihood and advance peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan without hindrance. We call on the US side to fully unfreeze the assets and lift unilateral sanctions on the country as soon as possible, take concrete actions to fulfill its primary responsibility for Afghanistan’s peace and reconstruction and show accountability to the world.Yonhap News Agency: Goguryeo-related content is missing from the exhibition of Ancient Bronzes of China, Korea, and Japan. According to ROK media reports, the Chinese and the ROK governments are having consultations over this. Can you share with us China’s position?Mao Ning: I shared China’s position the day before yesterday. Let me stress again that views regarding academic issues can be shared and discussed in a professional way within the academic sphere. It is hoped that the institutions responsible for organizing the exhibition can resolve the issue through friendly consultation.China is ready to work with the ROK side by following the understanding reached by the two sides in 2004 and continue to properly handle Goguryeo-related issues in line with the principle of separating historical issues and current ones and separating academic issues and political ones.AFP: The Iranian government said the other day that it is working to join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). What is China’s take on this?Mao Ning: The appeal and influence of the SCO have kept growing. China looks forward to having discussions and reaching consensus on the organization’s expansion during the SCO summit. Any update on this will be released on a timely basis. Please stay tuned.China News Service: It is reported that on September 14, China and Pacific Island Countries (PICs) held a dialogue and exchange meeting on climate change in Beijing. Could you give us more details on the meeting?Mao Ning: Yesterday, China’s special envoy on climate change Xie Zhenhua, together with diplomatic envoys from Tonga, Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu, held the China-Pacific Island Countries climate change dialogue and exchange meeting. Participants had an in-depth exchange of views on policies and actions to address climate change, expected outcomes of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and South-South cooperation on climate change. The meeting has produced positive outcomes. It deepened the parties’ understanding of each other’s strategies, plans, efforts and policies on climate change, and achieved the goal of enhancing mutual trust and promoting cooperation. The envoys from the participating PICs highly appreciated China’s climate actions and the results, and thanked China for providing valuable support to PICs’ efforts in this regard. They expressed the readiness to further strengthen dialogue and consultation with China and jointly make positive contributions to the multilateral climate process.As a responsible major country, China takes very seriously the special difficulties and concerns of PICs in addressing climate change. Over the years, China has provided PICs with material assistance and capacity-building training and other support to enhance their capacity to cope with climate change. China is ready to stay in close communication and cooperation with the PICs. We hope to help PICs better address climate change and achieve sustainable development through bilateral channels and South-South cooperation, including by making full use of the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Change Cooperation Center and other platforms. This is also part of the joint effort to build a China-PICs community with a shared future.Bloomberg: The European Union is proposing a forced labor product bans act. So this proposal, while it doesn’t single out China, it does mean that the EU would be able to withdraw or ban any product that was found to have used forced labor at any stage of production. So this is something that could potentially impact Xinjiang-made goods in the future. My question is, does the foreign ministry have any comment on the European Union’s proposed forced labor product ban?Mao Ning: The Chinese government follows a people-centered development philosophy and attaches great importance to protecting the rights and interests of workers. We protect the equal right of workers from all ethnic groups to seek employment, to participate in economic and social life, and to share the dividends of socioeconomic progress. In recent years, Xinjiang has enjoyed sustained economic development, social harmony and stability, continuous improvement of people’s livelihood, unprecedented cultural prosperity and religious harmony. There’s no so-called “forced labor” in China. We firmly oppose using the so-called “forced labor” or any Xinjiang-related issue to interfere in China’s internal affairs.Reuters: What is President Xi Jinping planning on telling Vladimir Putin in Uzbekistan?Mao Ning: I just answered a similar question. We will release information in due course.
9.16 CCTV: President Xi Jinping arrived in Samarkand and began his state visit to Uzbekistan yesterday. Could you share more information with us?Mao Ning: At the invitation of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of the Republic of Uzbekistan, President Xi Jinping arrived in Samarkand on the evening of September 14 and began his state visit to Uzbekistan. At the airport, he was warmly greeted by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who held a grand welcome ceremony for him. President Xi held official talks with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev and attended a welcome banquet. It is especially worth mentioning that he accepted the Order of Friendship conferred by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, which is the highest honor conferred by Uzbekistan on foreign individuals. This is the first time of awarding the Order. The two heads of state signed and issued the Joint Statement Between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Uzbekistan and decided to deepen the China-Uzbekistan comprehensive strategic partnership in the new era and build a community with a shared future at the bilateral level. Relevant departments of the two governments signed multiple cooperation documents covering agriculture, digital economy and green development, among others.Yesterday in Samarkand, President Xi also had bilateral meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov, Turkmen President Serdar Berdymukhamedov, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, Mongolian President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, and attended the sixth meeting of heads of state of China, Russia and Mongolia.President Xi had a fruitful state visit to Uzbekistan. The bilateral talks were candid and deep-going. The meeting of heads of state of China, Russia and Mongolia was positive and results-oriented.Parties expressed their readiness to further step up strategic communication and coordination with China, and show respect for each other’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and firm support for each other’s core interests and major concerns. They stressed their commitment to the one-China principle.Parties made it clear that they attach high importance to the high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and stand ready to form greater synergy between the BRI and their national development strategies. Relevant departments of China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan signed a trilateral memorandum of understanding concerning cooperation on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway (the section in Kyrgyzstan).Parties spoke highly of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s important role in upholding regional peace, security and stability. They said the authority and impact of the SCO has continued to increase and they were looking forward to positive outcomes of the SCO Samarkand summit.Parties highly commended the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative proposed by the Chinese side and expressed readiness to jointly work with China to implement them to jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind.Parties said that in the face of an increasingly complex international landscape, we should strengthen solidarity and coordination, respect the UN Charter and the basic principles of international law, pursue UN-centered multilateralism and jointly uphold international justice and fairness.Parties expressed congratulations to the upcoming 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and wished the meeting every success.AFP: During yesterday’s meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin, the two sides agreed to extend mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interests. Does this include China’s support for Russia on the Ukraine issue?Mao Ning: On September 15, President Xi Jinping held a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at Forumlar Majmuasi Complex in Samarkand to exchange views on China-Russia relations and international and regional issues of shared interest. China and Russia offer each other strong support on issues concerning each other’s core interests. As each other’s largest neighbors and comprehensive strategic partners of coordination for a new era, China and Russia have always followed the guidance of the common understandings between our two heads of state in growing bilateral relations and advancing exchange and cooperation in various sectors. If there’s anything more you wish to know, I’d like to refer you to our readout.MASTV: Spokesperson of the Taiwan authorities said on September 15 that Taiwan will send three persons to attend the state funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Do you have any comment? Is China still going to send someone to attend Abe’s state funeral?Mao Ning: Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The one-China principle is a widely accepted norm in international relations and a prevailing consensus of the international community. China urges Japan to abide by the principles of the four political documents between China and Japan and the serious political commitments it previously made, handle relevant matters in strict accordance with the one-China principle, and refrain from providing any platform or opportunity for “Taiwan independence” elements to take advantage of the occasion for political manipulation.As for Japan’s invitation to China for the state funeral of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, China and Japan are in communication over this. I do not have any information to offer at the moment.Dragon TV: Armed conflicts broke out between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops at the border between the two countries recently. Does China have any comments?Mao Ning: Azerbaijan and Armenia are both China’s friendly cooperation partners. We hope the two sides will observe the agreed ceasefire, avoid further escalation of the situation and resolve tensions and differences through political dialogue so that there can be peace and stability in the region and the people can live in peace.AFP: Will President Xi meet with Prime Minister Modi today? If yes, what will they discuss?Mao Ning: I have no information to offer.Global Times: After the US announced a planned arms sale worth $1.106 billion to Taiwan on September 2, the Spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China will “firmly defend our own sovereignty and security interests”. Do you have any updates about that?Mao Ning: US arms sales to China’s Taiwan region seriously violate the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué of 1982. The arms sales gravely undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests, and severely harm China-US relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns the sales.To defend China’s sovereignty and security interests, the Chinese government has decided to sanction Gregory J. Hayes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, and Theodore Colbert III, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, who were involved in the latest arms sale.China once again urges the US government and relevant parties to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués, stop arms sales to Taiwan and military contact with Taiwan, and stop creating factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait. China will continue to take all necessary measures in light of the situation to firmly defend its own sovereignty and security interests.Beijing Daily: On September 15, the Director-General of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and a delegation of the OPCW Executive Council paid a virtual visit to China and exchanged views with China and Japan on Japan’s abandoned chemical weapons (ACWs) in China. Can you share more information about the visit?Mao Ning: At the joint invitation of China and Japan, Fernando Arias, Director-General of the OPCW, and Ziad M.D. Al Atiyah, Chairperson of the Executive Council of the OPCW and Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia to the OPCW, led a delegation of more than 40 members to visit China virtually on September 15 for the specific issue you mentioned. The delegation consists of diplomatic envoys posted in the OPCW from more than 10 countries including Russia, Malaysia and Kenya and representatives from the US, the UK and Germany.During the visit, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li met with Director-General Arias and elaborated on China’s position and concerns on issues related to accelerating the destruction of Japanese ACWs. The delegation was briefed by officials from China and Japan on the overall situation and destruction progress of Japanese ACWs. They also visited virtually the largest burial site of Japanese ACWs discovered so far, which is located in Haerba Ling in Dunhua City, Jilin Province. The visit yielded good results. The delegation believes that great importance should be attached to the issue of Japanese ACWs, and efforts should be made to complete their total destruction as soon as possible, undo the harm to China, and build “a world free of chemical weapons”.I want to stress that Japanese ACWs are a major issue left over from history. Japan made an unequivocal, solemn commitment to China and the international community on this issue. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic relations and the 25th anniversary of the entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. The destruction process of Japanese ACWs has seriously lagged behind, and missed the deadlines for the destruction many times. We hope that the Japanese side will take seriously China’s grave concerns and the strong appeal of the international community, show the political will to fulfill its international obligations and the political courage to redress its historical crimes, and earnestly increase input to completely and thoroughly eliminate the harm of ACWs as soon as possible and return a clean land to the Chinese people.AFP: President Xi met with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Türkiye earlier today. Did they discuss human rights issues in Xinjiang, especially regarding the Uyghurs detained there?Mao Ning: Before answering your question, let me make it clear there is no so-called arbitrary detention of Uyghurs or human rights issues in Xinjiang. As to this bilateral meeting, I’d refer you to the press release the Chinese side has put out.Bloomberg: There’s a report that the UK Parliament refused Chinese delegation access to the Parliament building to attend the lying-in-state of the former Queen Elizabeth II. Can you confirm that this happened? And do you have any comment on this matter?Mao Ning: I haven’t seen the report you mentioned. I want to point out that the state funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is an important activity of the UK. Foreign delegations attend the activity at the invitation of the UK side to show respect to the late Queen and the importance they attach to the UK. As the host, the UK side is certainly familiar with diplomatic protocols and proper manners of receiving guests.RIA Novosti: A delegation from the Czech Republic will visit Taiwan on Sunday. What’s the Foreign Ministry’s comment?Mao Ning: There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair. It concerns China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and bears on China’s core interests. We firmly oppose all forms of official interaction between the Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China. We firmly oppose external forces’ attempt to use the Taiwan question to interfere in China’s internal affairs. The Chinese government and people have unwavering resolve and commitment to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge the Czech politicians to earnestly abide by the one-China principle, refrain from sending any wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” separatist forces, and avoid inflicting further damage to the political foundation of the development of bilateral relations.Reuters: A British Foreign Office source told Reuters that a Chinese leader is expected to attend Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral on Monday. Does the foreign ministry have any comments?Mao Ning: China is considering sending a high-level delegation to the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. We will release information in due course. Please check back for updates.AFP: President Xi Jinping met President Ebrahim Raisi today. Did President Xi urge his counterpart to revive the JCPOA? Is China ready to support Iran's SCO membership when issues related to the JCPOA are unresolved yet?Mao Ning: China has put out a readout about the meeting between President Xi and President Raisi and you may refer to that.Reuters: The President of Mongolia said on Thursday while meeting with President Xi and President Putin that he supports the construction of oil and gas pipelines from Russia to China via Mongolia. However, this specific point did not appear in the Chinese readout of this trilateral meeting. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on these remarks made by the Mongolian President?Mao Ning: The readout of the meeting of the heads of state of China, Russia and Mongolia says the three countries agreed to actively move forward the project on the Mongolian section of the China-Russia natural gas pipeline.
9.19 CCTV: Last Friday, President Xi Jinping wrapped up his trip to Central Asia, which has received international attention. During the trip, he attended the Samarkand Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and paid state visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. International commentary has described the trip as one of major strategic significance. How does China see its outcomes and significance?Mao Ning: President Xi Jinping’s trip to Central Asia is an important landmark visit undertaken at a crucial and historic juncture. As the trip came to an end, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave a detailed briefing. Within a 48-hour stay in the two Central Asian countries, President Xi attended nearly 30 multilateral and bilateral events. The visit has had many highlights and created fruitful outcomes. With its facilitation, the SCO has entered a new phase of development. The visit also successfully steered China’s relations with relevant countries to new levels.President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the Samarkand Summit, where he put forward major initiatives and proposals on greater unity among the member states and the future development of the SCO. He emphasized the need to enhance mutual support, expand security cooperation, deepen practical cooperation, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and uphold multilateralism. The Chinese side also announced that it is ready to establish a China-SCO base for training counter-terrorism personnel, host a forum on industrial and supply chains, set up a China-SCO Big Data Cooperation Center, and provide developing countries in need with emergency humanitarian assistance of grain and other supplies worth 1.5 billion yuan. These proposals and initiatives of China have received a positive response from other countries. The Samarkand Summit set a new record in three aspects. First, it adopted 44 outcome documents, the highest number recorded. Second, it saw the broadest participation, with the attendance of leaders of 14 countries including SCO member states, observer states and the Presidency’s guests, and heads of nine international organizations and institutions such as the UN. Third, it marked the largest round of expansion for the SCO, as a memorandum of obligations on Iran’s membership was signed, the procedure for Belarus’s accession was started, the status of SCO dialogue partners was granted to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and agreement was reached on admitting Bahrain, the Maldives, the UAE, Kuwait, and Myanmar as new dialogue partners.During President Xi Jinping’s fruitful state visits to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, a wide-ranging consensus was reached on the future direction and priorities of cooperation, writing a new chapter of good-neighborly friendship between China and the two countries. The launch of the concept of a community with a shared future between China and Kazakhstan and between China and Uzbekistan at the bilateral level is an integral part of the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. It will better benefit the people of the three countries and contribute to regional peace and development.President Xi Jinping also held bilateral meetings in Samarkand with the leaders of 10 countries attending the SCO Summit at their request and attended the trilateral meeting between China, Russia and Mongolia to deepen strategic communication with all parties. The meetings covered many topics, reached significant depth and produced substantive results, which play an important role in guiding the growth of bilateral relations and inject positive energy into the peaceful development of the Eurasian continent.Throughout this visit, we can strongly feel the international community’s firm support for China and eager expectation for deepening friendship and cooperation with China. Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, China has been a constructive force in international relations. We will continue to promote dialogue and cooperation, advance unity and openness, safeguard peace and development, and play an increasingly important role for the long-term stability and sustainable development of the Eurasian continent and the world at large.Shenzhen TV: The 19th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit were held recently in Nanning, Guangxi. The expo has served as a traditional platform for China-ASEAN economic and trade cooperation since 2004. Can you talk about the special significance and outcomes of this expo?Mao Ning: This year marks the establishment of the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership and the entry into force and the start of the implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Under the theme of “Sharing RCEP New Opportunities, Building a Version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area”, this year’s China-ASEAN Expo saw 40 investment promotion activities with 1,653 enterprises participating in offline events and more than 2,000 enterprises participating in online events. A total of 267 cooperation projects were inked with a record high investment of 413 billion yuan, up by 37% from the previous expo.Han Zheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the opening ceremony of the expo and delivered a keynote speech. Leaders of seven ASEAN countries including Malaysian Prime Minister Dato’ Sri Ismail Sabri bin Yaakob, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, and Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos, and the ASEAN Secretary-General, among others, addressed the event virtually. All sides agreed on the need for high-quality implementation of RCEP, building a version 3.0 China-ASEAN Free Trade Area, and deeper integration of industrial, supply and value chains.As an important platform for deepening China-ASEAN cooperation and advancing regional economic integration, the China-ASEAN Expo will surely inject new impetus and bring new opportunities for facilitating post-COVID sustainable recovery and building an open regional economy.Bloomberg: A top Chinese health official warned people against having skin-to-skin contact with foreigners to avoid contracting Monkeypox. Is that the official stance of the Chinese government? And has the foreign ministry ordered its employees in China and abroad to stop touching foreigners?Mao Ning: This is not a question about diplomacy and I would refer you to competent authorities.Reuters: Mr. Wu Zunyou warned against having skin-to-skin contact with foreigners. Does the foreign ministry agree with such health awareness?Mao Ning: This is a question about science and public health. I would refer you to competent authorities.The Paper: According to Japanese media reports, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said in a recent statement that an analysis of the sampled ALPS treated nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant showed that the activity concentration of Sr-90 in the sample was about three times that of Japan’s national standard. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: I noted relevant reports. This fully shows that the international community’s concerns over the reliability of Japan’s data, the effectiveness of the purification equipment and the uncertainties about the environmental impact are entirely justified. Despite all the doubts over Japan’s plan to discharge the nuclear-contaminated water into the sea and the fact that the international community’s legitimate concerns have not yet been properly addressed, Japan has pushed ahead with the discharge plan and the construction of the discharge pipeline. This is extremely irresponsible.The ocean is not Japan’s waste dump; and the Pacific Ocean is not Japan’s sewer. China again urges Japan to stop pushing through the plan to discharge the water into the ocean, take seriously the legitimate concerns of all countries, earnestly fulfill its due international obligations, have a full consultation with relevant international organizations and stakeholders including its neighbors, and find a proper way to dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a science-based, open, transparent and safe manner.Reuters: The Taiwanese representative to the UK has been given a special invitation to sign the condolence book for the Queen. Is the Chinese foreign ministry OK with this?Mao Ning: It is rather contemptible for the DPP authorities to use the condolence arrangement for political hype and political gains. Such a move cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China and that such political schemes of the DPP authorities will never succeed.Prasar Bharati: China, last week, for the third time in the last three months blocked a proposal at the United Nations to blacklist a Pakistan-based top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Sajid Mir, who was involved in the 2008 Mumbai attacks and attacks in the US and Denmark. Why did China do this and can you give any reason? What message does China want to give to the world regarding anti-terrorism as a permanent member of the UNSC?Mao Ning: I believe you were referring to the designation issue at the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council. The committee has clear guidelines regarding the designation of terrorist organizations and individuals and related procedures. China always takes part in the work of the committee in a constructive and responsible manner in strict accordance with the rules and procedures.Follow-up: As per the procedures you and your colleagues have mentioned in the past three months, is there any timeline that China will withdraw its blockage and remove its opposition to the listing?Mao Ning: China’s actions at the 1267 Committee are always consistent with relevant rules and procedures. We will continue to conduct our work in a constructive and responsible manner.
9.20 CCTV: According to reports, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had an exchange with representatives of the National Committee on US-China Relations, the US-China Business Council and the US Chamber of Commerce, and met with former US Secretary of State Dr. Kissinger in New York on September 19 local time. Can you share more information?Wang Wenbin: On September 19 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had an exchange with representatives of the National Committee on US-China Relations, the US-China Business Council and the US Chamber of Commerce in New York.Wang Yi pointed out that this year marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the Shanghai Communiqué. It is an important year to take stock of the past and carry on from a new starting point. But one may find less certainty and more uncertainty in the prospects of China-US relations. In that context, Wang Yi talked about the five certainties China can provide.First, China’s development prospects are certain. The upcoming 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China will lay out the blueprint and the objectives of China’s future development. A modernized China with more than 1.4 billion people approaching common prosperity will create bigger markets and development opportunities for the US and other countries.Second, China’s resolve to further advance reform and opening-up is certain. China will continue to deepen reform and open up even wider, foster a new system of opening-up of higher standards, build an open world economy and continue to advance economic globalization.Third, China’s policy toward the US is certain. President Xi Jinping put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation in developing China-US relations. President Joe Biden has reiterated the “five noes” commitment (i.e. the US does not seek a new Cold War with China, it does not aim to change China’s system, the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China, it does not support “Taiwan independence”, and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China) on many occasions. The most critical thing now is for the US to adopt a rational and practical policy toward China sooner rather than later.Fourth, China’s commitment to closer bilateral trade and economic cooperation is certain. China welcomes US business operations in China and will continue to provide a market-oriented, world-class business environment governed by a sound legal framework. We need to have more, not less, economic and trade interactions between China and the US. We need to “join hands” with each other instead of “letting go” of each other’s hands. We need to remove barriers, not build up walls. We need dialogue and consultation, not confrontation or coercion, when it comes to each other’s concerns.Fifth, China’s readiness to engage in multilateral consultation with the US is certain. History has proven and will continue to prove that when China and the US cooperate, the two sides can accomplish many big things that are good for the two countries and for the world. For that to happen, it is vital to protect the political foundation for China-US relations and in particular, uphold the one-China principle.Wang Yi stressed that China-US relations bear on the future of the two countries and the peace and stability of the world. The two sides need to work together to find a way for the two major countries with different social systems, histories and cultures to get along.When meeting with former US Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, Wang Yi said that this year marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the issuance of the Shanghai Communiqué. China and the US should earnestly take stock of the useful experience in the 50 years of exchanges. China’s policy toward the US remains consistent and stable. The US, out of a wrong perception of China, insists on viewing China as its primary rival and a long-term challenge. Some people even described stories of the success of China-US exchanges as failures. This is a lack of respect for both history and these people themselves. The US needs to adopt a rational and practical policy toward China, return to the right track of the three China-US joint communiqués, and safeguard the political foundation of China-US relations.Wang Yi stressed that the pressing task is to properly manage the Taiwan question; otherwise, it would have a disruptive impact on China-US relations. A Chinese saying goes to the effect that “To defend even an inch of land, a country will not hesitate to sacrifice thousands of troops.” The saying reflects the will and resolve of the Chinese people. If the Anti-Secession Law is violated, China will surely take firm action in accordance with the law to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Wang Yi stressed that to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, the US must return to the true meaning of the one-China principle, and unequivocally oppose and curb “Taiwan independence” activities.The US participants said that as the world’s two largest economies that are interdependent, if China and the US can manage their bilateral relations well, reduce impediments and negative factors and jointly respond to climate change, public health and food and energy security challenges, people of both countries and the world at large will enjoy more benefits. The two sides need to work in a cooperative spirit and in the right direction and keep having constructive and productive dialogues at various levels. Small steps can build into major progress. The level of trust will also grow. This will contribute to world peace, stability and prosperity.Hubei Media Group: We have learned that the second Middle East Security Forum will be held in Beijing on September 21 in an online-plus-offline format by the China Institute of International Studies. Can you share more information?Wang Wenbin: The world has entered a new period of volatility and transformation. The Middle East is facing new security challenges. China attaches great importance to peace and security in the Middle East. In 2018, President Xi Jinping put forward that we must together pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security in the Middle East in his remarks delivered at the opening ceremony of the 8th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum. Over the past year or so, China has proposed a five-point initiative on achieving security and stability in the Middle East, a four-point proposal for the political settlement of the Syrian issue, and a three-point vision for the implementation of the two-state solution to the Palestinian question, contributing China’s insight and solution to addressing the issues. In April this year, President Xi put forward the Global Security Initiative (GSI), pointing out the direction and way forward for peace and stability in the Middle East.In November 2019, the China Institute of International Studies successfully held the first Middle East Security Forum in Beijing, where officials, experts and scholars from China and other countries concerned had fruitful dialogues and exchanges. China will hold the second forum to follow through on President Xi’s remarks, and work together with the regional countries to implement the GSI, build up the new security framework in the Middle East and realize common security in the region. The meetings, which will be held in an online-plus-offline format, consist of two subforum sessions about the Palestinian question and the security situation in the Gulf region. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will address the opening ceremony via video, Vice Foreign Minister Deng Li will deliver a keynote speech, and important guests will also address the forum. More than 70 participants, including diplomatic and security officials and scholars of Middle East countries and beyond, representatives from the Chinese foreign ministry and defense ministry, former Chinese diplomatic envoys and experts with think tanks, will share views on subjects including the Palestinian question and the security in the Gulf region.We hope that this upcoming forum will provide an opportunity and a platform for the parties to explore new ideas and new pathways in security governance in the Middle East.People’s Daily: We noted that the International Forum on Resilient and Stable Industrial and Supply Chains took place in Hangzhou. Could you share more with us?Wang Wenbin: To implement President Xi Jinping’s important proposal at the G20 Leaders’ Summit last year, China held the International Forum on Resilient and Stable Industrial and Supply Chains in an online-plus-offline format from September 19 to 20.President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the forum. In his letter, President Xi noted that maintaining the resilience and stability of the global industrial and supply chains is a vital guarantee for promoting the development of the world economy and serves the common interests of people globally. China will unswervingly ensure that the industrial and supply chains are public goods in nature. We will work with countries in the world to build a global industrial and supply chain system that is secure, stable, smooth, efficient, open, inclusive, and mutually beneficial, and contribute to promoting global economic circulation, boosting the growth of the world economy and enhancing the wellbeing of humanity. Vice Premier Liu He attended the event and read out the congratulatory letter.State leaders and ministerial officials from 15 countries, including Argentine President Alberto Fernández and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, attended the forum via video link, and diplomatic envoys in China from 29 countries and representatives from four international organizations and many transnational companies attended the event in person. They had dialogue and exchanges on such issues as enhancing global industrial collaboration, facilitating unimpeded international logistics and boosting global economic recovery.At the forum, China, 2022 G20 chair Indonesia, Chile, Cuba, Pakistan, and Serbia jointly proposed the Initiative of International Cooperation on Resilient and Stable Industrial and Supply Chains, asking all countries to join them in a more equitable, inclusive and constructive partnership for industrial and supply chains, in a bid to jointly build a beautiful and prosperous world.China Daily: According to the latest reports released by the National Bureau of Statistics on the progress of China’s socioeconomic development over the past decade following the 18th National Congress of the CPC, China’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an average annual growth rate of 6.6 percent from 2013 to 2021, higher than the average growth rate of 2.6 percent for the global economy and 3.7 percent for developing economies. Do you have any comment on this?Wang Wenbin: I noted the relevant reports. The reports show that in 2021, China’s economic aggregate accounted for 18.5 percent of the world’s total, up by 7.2 percentage points from 2012. China’s average contribution to global economic growth exceeded 30 percent during the past decade or so, ranking first across the world. The numbers show China is a stabilizer and engine for world economic growth.In recent years, globalization has encountered headwinds. Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. The world economy is in the doldrums. Despite difficulties and challenges, China still believes that openness and cooperation is the way forward and win-win cooperation has the support of the people. China remains committed to wider, broader and deeper opening-up. A lot has been done to promote trade and investment facilitation and liberalization. We have made sustained efforts to create a market-oriented, world-class business environment governed by a sound legal framework, which has made the Chinese market a world market shared by all and a source of momentum and stability for world economic recovery.China’s door will only open wider and will never be closed. We stand ready to work with countries in the world in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness and win-win results, expand practical cooperation across the board and let countries better share China’s development opportunities.CCTV: American independent journalist Ben Norton noted the other day, citing data from the US Congressional Research Service, that the US launched 469 military interventions overseas from 1798 to 2022. For just 30-plus years since the end of the Cold War, the US has waged 251 military interventions, far outnumbering the tally of the 190-plus years before the end of the Cold War. What’s China’s comment?Wang Wenbin: We have noted relevant reports. The US has repeatedly claimed that it respects and defends the “rules-based international order”. However, the statistics released by the US Congress have shown the world the bellicose and hegemonic nature of US rules.The US was not at war for only 16 years throughout its 240-plus years of history. Following the end of the Cold War, the world anticipated the US to reduce its overseas military operations. But what happened was the opposite. After the Cold War, the US launched military operations seven times more frequently than before the Cold War. All of these numbers are conservative estimates, because they do not include things like US special operations and covert actions. It is also pointed out in Norton’s report that the list of countries targeted by the US military includes the vast majority of the nations on Earth, including almost every single county in Latin America and the Caribbean and most of the African continent.Instead of peddling itself as a defender of so-called rules and order and attacking, accusing and smearing others, the US needs to earnestly reflect on its warlike behavior and constant interference in others’ internal affairs, get rid of such wrongful habits and stop being the world’s No.1 maker of war.
9.21 CCTV: The CSIS, a US think tank, recently held an online seminar on the new Global Development Initiative. Some experts said at the meeting that the Global Development Initiative (GDI) is framed around accelerating the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It can help all parties pool strength, increase the efficiency of the use of development resources and can form synergy with developing countries’ development strategies. The experts also noted that the West should not “throw the baby out with the bath water” when it comes to the GDI, but engage with China through communication and coordination to ensure that the initiative can truly play its part. What is China’s comment?Wang Wenbin: I have noted the relevant reports. We appreciate the experts’ objective and fair view of the GDI. A year ago today, President Xi Jinping put forward the GDI at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Over the past year, the GDI has encouraged the international community to take the issue of development seriously once again and reaffirm its commitment to realizing the sustainable development goals on schedule. The GDI has put forward a viable pathway, created a cooperation platform, and pooled development resources to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and responded to the most pressing challenges to development. Over the past year, the number of countries and international organizations supporting the GDI has grown to more than 100, and the Group of Friends of the GDI on the UN platform now has more than 60 member states. China has been working with other countries in actively following through on the pragmatic steps to achieve the 32 deliverables of the High-level Dialogue on Global Development to advance GDI cooperation and has achieved many early harvests. We launched an International NGOs Network for Poverty Reduction Cooperation, which is joined by organizations from 17 countries and regions already as the first batch. We are working with 150 institutions from nearly 40 countries and regions to jointly establish a World Technical and Vocational Education and Training League. The Group of Friends has made clear the joint proposition on food security at the UNGA. The China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Change Cooperation Center has been established. China has conducted joint production of COVID vaccines with 13 countries, including nine members of the Group of Friends. We have provided training for more than 40,000 people in developing countries through 1,000 capacity-building programs.The GDI is centered around the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and is led by practical cooperation programs in key areas. It seeks better alignment with the UN and attaches importance to the role of the UN development system. It is dedicated to forging greater synergy with the development process of regions, subregions and country blocs, pooling and leveraging resources, and better serving the actual development needs of developing countries. In line with the GDI’s spirit of open and inclusive partnership, we welcome partners including developed countries’ participation in cooperation under the initiative to jointly bring global development to a new height, and forge the broadest synergy possible to meet all sustainable development goals on schedule.Bloomberg: Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said in a televised address that he would use all available means in the fight over Ukraine. What’s the foreign ministry’s comment on Vladimir Putin’s latest words about the escalation of force on Ukraine?Wang Wenbin: China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We call on the parties concerned to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation and find a solution that accommodates all parties’ legitimate security concerns. We also hope the international community will create conditions and space for that.Xinhua News Agency: The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently issued the Global guidance framework for the responsible use of the life sciences. The framework noted the high-level principles of the Tianjin Biosecurity Guidelines for Codes of Conduct for Scientists spearheaded by Tianjin University, which outlines a set of ethical norms proposed by the Chinese side. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: I’m glad to note that the Global guidance framework for the responsible use of the life sciences recognizes the Tianjin Guidelines as high-level principles. This WHO document is the first global, technical and normative framework in biorisk management. The fact that it has included and introduced the Tianjin Guidelines as high-level principles is of great significance for promoting responsible biological research around the world. It fully demonstrates the international science community’s resolve to better regulate and promote biological research.The Tianjin Guidelines is the first international initiative on biosecurity that is named after a Chinese locality with Chinese proposals as the main content. It was developed collaboratively by Tianjin University of China and Johns Hopkins University of the US with input from scientists from multiple countries. It consists of 10 guiding principles and norms. It calls for stronger biosecurity awareness among researchers and responsible bioscience research from such perspectives as responsibilities of researchers, research findings dissemination, public engagement in science and technology, and international cooperation. It also encourages governments and research institutions to strengthen supervision and self-discipline to better translate bioscience progress into benefits for mankind.Biosecurity knows no borders. It is China’s hope that through the concerted efforts of the international community, biological science and technology will flourish along the right path of greater safety and security.TASS: The People’s Republic of Donetsk and Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia said that they will hold referendums on joining Russia from September 23 to 27. Do you have any comments on this?Wang Wenbin: China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. We believe that all countries deserve respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed, that the legitimate security concerns of any country should be taken seriously, and that support should be given to all efforts that are conducive to peacefully resolving the crisis. We call on the parties concerned to properly address differences through dialogue and consultation. China stands ready to work with members of the international community to continue to play a constructive part in deescalation efforts.CRI: According to reports, there has been continued armed conflict along the border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan since September 14. The two sides have reached a ceasefire agreement, but the border situation remains tense. Does China have any comment?Wang Wenbin: Both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are China’s friendly neighbors and comprehensive strategic partners. We hope and believe that the two countries have the ability to work through their differences and disputes properly in the spirit of mutual respect and friendly consultation and keep the region peaceful and stable.Associated Press: I’d like to ask about the joint military exercises in Fiji. The United States, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji have been holding joint military exercises since last week, and this is set to conclude this Friday. Some see this as an effort to counter China’s influence in the region, and we’d like to ask the Chinese foreign ministry for any comments on this ongoing military exercise.Wang Wenbin: We do not oppose normal defense cooperation between relevant countries. But such cooperation should not target any third parties.Bloomberg: According to a report issued today by the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, China is losing its appeal among many European companies who are rethinking their future investments. Does the foreign ministry have a comment on this?Wang Wenbin: We noted the relevant report. First of all, if you look at the statistics released by China on inbound foreign investment for the first eight months of this year, you will find that European countries are among the fastest growing sources of investment in China. In a world still struggling to fight the pandemic and lift the global economy, China has both brought COVID under control and achieved social and economic progress. China was the first major economy in the world to register positive growth, providing strong assurance for foreign companies to do business in China. When all things are considered, China’s COVID measures have worked best and been most cost-effective.China is actively building a new development paradigm. China’s efforts to build a new system of an open economy at a higher level and a market-oriented, world-class business environment governed by a sound legal framework will create broader development opportunities for businesses from Europe and elsewhere, and open up new prospects for China-Europe economic and trade cooperation. We hope that relevant parties including Europe will provide an open, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies as well.Bloomberg: There have been some reports of a visit to China by German Chancellor Scholz in early November. Does the foreign ministry have any details on that proposed visit? Can you confirm that this is happening? Secondly, in an address to the UN, German Chancellor Scholz said that China should implement the recommendations of the recent report by the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet. Can you comment on the trip’s possibility and also the remarks made about the Xinjiang report?Wang Wenbin: On your first question, I have nothing to share.On your second question, we have made China’s position clear. I would like to reiterate what we have said previously. The so-called assessment is orchestrated and produced by the US and some Western forces and is completely illegal, null and void. It is a patchwork of disinformation that serves as a political tool for the US and some Western forces to strategically use Xinjiang to contain China. The OHCHR’s so-called assessment is predicated on the political scheme of some anti-China forces outside China. This seriously violates the mandate of the OHCHR and the principles of universality, objectivity, non-selectivity and non-politicization. It once again shows that the OHCHR has been reduced to an enforcer and accomplice of the US and some Western forces in forcing the developing countries to fall into line with them.In recent years, nearly 100 countries, including Muslim countries, have spoken out at the Human Rights Council, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly and on other public occasions to support China’s justified position on issues including Xinjiang and oppose interference in China’s internal affairs in the name of so-called Xinjiang-related issues. They are the mainstream of the international community. The US and some Western forces seek to destabilize Xinjiang and use it to contain China. Their unjust, pernicious political agenda will not have people’s support and will only fail.Reuters: Just to follow up on the questions about President Vladimir Putin’s televised address today, in these remarks, he also said that Russia would launch a partial military mobilization. This is Russia’s first mobilization since World War II. Is the foreign ministry concerned about how the situation is developing given that a military mobilization hasn’t been announced in such a long time?Wang Wenbin: I already stated China’s position on the Ukraine crisis and I’m not going to go over it again.Bloomberg: Also there are reports of a visit to China by French President Emmanuel Macron. Can you comment on that report? Is it accurate that this is going to happen?Wang Wenbin: I have nothing to share at the moment.Reuters: Top adviser to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Counselor Brent Neiman, said in a speech seen by Reuters on Tuesday that China’s debt practices were “unconventional” and that they had failed to provide meaningful debt relief to low and middle-income countries. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Wang Wenbin: China has always taken seriously the debt issue of developing countries.I need to underscore the following points.First, developing countries mainly borrow from commercial and multilateral lenders. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, by the end of 2020, commercial and multilateral creditors accounted for 40% and 34% respectively for the public external debt of 82 low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Bilateral official creditors took up 26% and China less than 10%. In recent years, developing countries have mainly borrowed their new debts from Western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions. The developing countries’ medium- to long-term debt payment mainly flows to Western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions. What you quoted from the US side is not based on facts.Second, China has been doing its utmost to support developing countries as they seek to address their difficulties in line with the principle of joint actions and fair burden-sharing. China is part of the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative for Poorest Countries and the agreement on its extension. China has fully implemented them and ranked first among G20 members in terms of deferral amount. By contrast, Western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions, who hold the biggest share of debts, refuse to be part of the effort, citing a need to maintain their credit rating, and have thus failed to make proportionate contributions to relieving the debt burden of developing countries.We call on the US to earnestly fulfill its due responsibilities, and make real contributions to easing the debt burden of developing countries instead of deflecting blame.Global Times: According to a report by SANA on September 20, the illegal US occupation forces in the north-eastern Syrian governorate of Hasakah looted new quantities of Syrian oil via 60 tankers, bringing them out to the north of Iraq. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: I noted relevant reports. This is not the first time that US troops stole oil from Syria. Their banditry has only grown more reckless. According to a statement from Syria’s Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources, the average daily oil production during the first half of 2022 was around 80,300 barrels, while the US occupation forces and their mercenaries stole up to 66,000 barrels every single day, or 82% of total oil production. According to reports, since the beginning of August, there have been at least 10 oil thefts by US troops in Syria. Some 800 tankers were used to transport stolen oil to US bases outside of Syria. In the meantime, Syrian people have had to queue for hours to fill up at gas stations. A senior Syrian official said in an interview that the estimated value of direct losses resulting from the US military’s extraction, smuggling and illegal trade in Syrian oil, gas and mineral resources amounted to $18.2 billion by the end of the first half of 2022. Also, more than 14 million civilians in Syria are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. What the US troops have done has made the humanitarian disaster even more devastating for Syria.Syria is yet another victim of the US’s “rules-based order”, just like Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Under this order, the Syrian people are being deprived of their rights and lives, instead of being protected. We urge the US to respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and respond to the call of the Syrian people. The US needs to at once lift the unilateral sanctions on Syria, stop plundering Syria’s national resources, hold the US troops legally accountable, compensate the Syrian people and take concrete action to remedy the pain they have inflicted on Syria.Associated Press: The United States has promised greater engagement with the South Pacific, in particular, after China and Solomon Islands had signed a bilateral security treaty earlier this year. This also includes a comment by US Vice President Kamala Harris that they would open new embassies in Tonga and Kiribati. I’d like to first ask for your comments on such increased engagement in the region by the US and also Australia, which is also taking steps to do so. Second question, a destroyer USS Higgins and a Canadian frigate HMCS Vancouver had traversed the Taiwan Strait. The US Navy has said in a statement that the joint maneuver is a demonstration and commitment of the United States and the allies to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Do you have any comments about that?Wang Wenbin: On your first question, let me first say that Pacific Islands Countries (PICs) are independent sovereign countries and they have the right and freedom to develop friendly cooperation with other countries which should not be constrained or denied.Secondly, China never attaches any political strings to its friendly and cooperative ties with the PICs. Growing relations with the PICs is not about seeking a “sphere of influence” and does not target any third party. As noted by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during his meeting with Foreign Minister of Solomon Islands Jeremiah Manele in New York yesterday, developing countries have the right to development as much as anyone else, and their people are entitled to a happy life. China’s cooperation with the PICs is about promoting common development and improving people’s wellbeing. It is warmly welcomed by the local people.On your second question, the spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese PLA has issued a statement on that. According to the spokesperson, the Chinese troops tracked and monitored the US and Canadian warships the entire time and stayed on high alert at all times to resolutely counter any threat or provocation and safeguard China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity.The current situation in the Taiwan Strait is complex and sensitive. Recently, US warships have repeatedly flexed muscles and made provocations in the Taiwan Strait under the pretext of “freedom of navigation”. The US has also been ganging up with other countries and resorting to pressure and intimidation. This is worsening the tensions and hurting the peace and stability in the region.We urge the US side to clean up its act, rectify its erroneous practice and stop being a troublemaker for regional peace and stability. We also urge other countries to act prudently and not to seek to pull chestnut out of the fire.Reuters: On Tuesday, the US Federal Communications Commission named Chinese telecom companies China Unicom and Pacific Networks Corp and its wholly-owned subsidiary ComNet as threats to US national security. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Wang Wenbin: This is yet another example of the US overstretching the concept of national security and abusing state power to suppress Chinese companies. What the US did violates the rules of the market economy, undermines international economic and trade order and seriously hurts the interests of Chinese companies. China firmly rejects this. We urge the US side to immediately change its wrong course of action and stop hobbling and suppressing Chinese companies. We will continue to take necessary measures to firmly uphold the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies.
9.22 MASTV: World Bank President David Malpass said recently that “China’s unwillingness to deliver more stimulus during the current international slowdown is putting more pressure on the US to support international growth”. What is China’s comment?Zhao Lijian: As the largest emerging economy, China is a key locomotive and stabilizer of world economic growth. The China Economic Update released by the World Bank in June gave a positive review of China’s effective fiscal and monetary policies. During the China International Fair for Trade in Services this year, World Bank officials also said that China’s latest measures of further opening-up will boost post-COVID global economic recovery.The US, however, is another story. To resolve staggering inflation in the US, the Federal Reserve has resorted to rate hikes several times. The rapid appreciation of the US dollar has led to the depreciation of 36 currencies by at least one-tenth. This has left many developing countries in a bitter economic recession caused by currency depreciation, capital flight, the soaring cost of financing and debt repayment and imported inflation. Countless families were plunged into poverty overnight. The struggling world economy is taking yet another toll from this. The Wall Street Journal also pointed out recently that the dollar’s rapid rise is causing global economic woes.The US should adopt responsible economic and financial policies and act responsibly for safeguarding international financial stability and promoting world economic recovery. It is the US that the World Bank needs to focus its efforts on in this regard.Reuters: During a hearing before the US House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Republican congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer pressed US banking chief executives on how they would respond in the hypothetical event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The chief executives all said they would follow US government guidance suggesting a reduced or even removal of their bank’s presence in the Chinese market. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Zhao Lijian: The Taiwan question has always been the most central and sensitive issue in China-US relations. The US side needs to abide by the one-China principle and provisions in the three China-US joint communiqués, earnestly follow through on the US leader’s statement of not supporting “Taiwan independence”, and stop manipulating Taiwan-related issues.CCTV: President Xi Jinping put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI) at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, which has been actively supported and warmly responded to by the international community. On the GDI’s first anniversary, China chaired the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI. What was the consideration and what were the outcomes?Zhao Lijian: In September last year, President Xi Jinping put forward the GDI to galvanize international commitment to development and accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. So far, more than 100 countries and international organizations have supported the Initiative and more than 60 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI. In June, President Xi Jinping chaired the High-level Dialogue on Global Development, which charted the course for the implementation of the GDI.On the first anniversary of the GDI, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI in New York. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres delivered remarks via video link. Heads of nearly 10 international organizations and high-level representatives from 60 countries, including foreign ministers of nearly 40 countries, attended the meeting. This meeting was a major event during this year’s UNGA and produced positive outcomes.First, it consolidated the international consensus on GDI cooperation. Secretary-General Guterres and participants at the meeting spoke highly of President Xi’s vision as demonstrated by the GDI. They said that the Initiative is of great significance for boosting international cooperation on development and implementing the 2030 Agenda, and believed that it can be a catalyst for the faster development of developing countries and small- and medium-sized countries in particular. Parties will continue to deepen their participation in GDI cooperation and synergize the Initiative with the strategies of international organizations, regions and countries and pool efforts together.Second, it identified the pathway for advancing the Initiative on six fronts. The implementation of the GDI will focus on the central task of implementing the 2030 Agenda. It will be projects-led through promoting policy dialogue, experience sharing, capacity building and practical cooperation. It welcomes extensive participation, with the UN as an important cooperation partner and the Group of Friends of the GDI as the main body, to build a good example of cooperation and encourage the participation of others. It will increase input by fully leveraging the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund and the China-UN Peace and Development Trust Fund to pool more resources. It will advance all-round GDI cooperation by strengthening cooperation in the eight key areas of the Initiative to ensure that all 17 sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda can be met. It will have a special focus on key issues, including pressing challenges such as food and energy security, in the full implementation of the GDI.Third, it witnessed China’s proposal of seven practical measures. They include the release of the first batch of projects of the GDI project pool, the announcement of specific actions on food security, clean energy and customs cooperation, the establishment of the World Digital Education Alliance under China’s initiative, the start of formulating the Bamboo as a Substitute for Plastics Global Action Plan, China’s pledge to make available globally the data acquired by the Sustainable Development Science Satellite (SDGSAT-1) launched by China, and the presentation of six global data products for sustainable development to the UN. These measures have demonstrated China’s firm resolve and specific actions to advance the Initiative and were warmly welcomed.As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, the meeting has shown countries’ support for the GDI and their firm commitment to accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We believe that with the support of all parties, the Initiative will be further deepened and substantiated, and inject new momentum into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.The Paper: Today marks the 160th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. However, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, about 45% of African Americans in the US said equality is not likely to happen. Do you have any comment?Zhao Lijian: Slave trade was an original sin of the US. Slavery remained legal in the US for a third of the country’s 246-year history. According to Statista, a German statistics company, there were nearly 700,000 Black slaves in the US in 1790, and the number exceeded 3.95 million in 1860.The US issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862. However, today, 160 years later, African Americans still find themselves not emancipated from the yoke of racial discrimination. Statistics show that African Americans, who account for less than 13% of the US population, are more than twice as likely to be shot by the police, 2.9 times more likely to die from police brutality, and almost six times more likely to be imprisoned than white Americans. African Americans are infected with COVID-19 at three times the rate of white Americans and 1.9 times more likely to die from the virus. Their average life expectancy would shorten by 2.1 years due to the pandemic compared to 0.68 years for white Americans. According to the Pew Research Center survey conducted in August, 77% of African American adults said descendants of people enslaved in the nation should receive compensation, though most respondents think they will not see it in their lifetimes.The US government needs to face its historical sin squarely and actually do something to improve the human rights conditions of racial minorities at home, rather than use human rights as a pretext to malign and smear other countries around the world.Bloomberg: What is China’s view on the Afghan Taliban’s ties with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM)? Has the Taliban shown concrete steps in limiting their association with ETIM? And is this the main reason why China hasn’t invested in Afghanistan?Zhao Lijian: Regarding the relationship between the Afghan Taliban and ETIM, I think you need to raise your question to the Afghan Taliban. Judging from China’s communication with the Afghan Taliban, the Afghan Taliban has said repeatedly that it will not allow Afghanistan’s territory to be used by any terrorist organizations to attack China or any other country. We hope the Afghan side can earnestly fulfill this commitment.As to China’s investment in Afghanistan, I have some knowledge of the investment projects there from my posting in Pakistan. China has invested in such projects in Afghanistan as the Mes Aynak copper mine. Relevant Chinese companies have maintained contact and consultations with the Afghan side. The Chinese government has open lines of communication with the Afghan side over the projects. Also, the Chinese government has provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to help the Afghan people pull through the humanitarian crisis.Beijing Youth Daily: According to reports, the Yokosuka Municipal Government of Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan recently announced that the amount of toxic fluorine compounds detected in drainage water from a US naval base there exceeded Japanese government-set limits. The municipality has filed complaints to the US troops and they have yet to offer any explanation. Do you have any comment?Zhao Lijian: This is not the first time that the US troops in Japan dumped toxic substances. This again shows the world how much harm the US troops in Japan have done, using extraterritoriality as their shield, to the local environment and people’s lives.Saving the benefits of something to itself and leaving the environmental cost to others is the US’s standard practice. As the world’s largest exporter of solid waste and a major consumer of plastic in per capita terms, the US has yet to ratify the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. The US has long taken developing countries whose handling capacity is still inadequate as the final dumping site of plastic waste. According to a report released by the NGO Basel Action Network (BAN), US companies were still illegally exporting hazardous electronic waste to developing countries in 2020.In the US, racial minorities including the American Indians, African Americans and Latinos face serious environmental inequities. The US government has systematically used Indian reservations as toxic or nuclear waste dumps through the means of deception and coercion. As a result, the cancer incidence and fatality rates in the communities concerned are significantly higher than in other parts of the country. Numerous studies have shown a higher percentage of African and Hispanic communities that are exposed to air pollution, toxic waste sites, landfills and lead poisoning compared to white communities. UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance said in a statement that environmental racism poses serious threats to the enjoyment of several human rights of African American residents, including the right to life, the right to health and the right to an adequate standard of living.Environmental issues are humanity’s shared challenge. They are issues for the global commons. As the most advanced developed country, the US needs to fulfill its obligations on global environmental governance in good faith, stop recklessly damaging other countries’ environment and do something to protect racial minorities at home from environmental racism.CNR: On September 21, President Xi Jinping’s Special Representative State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the Informal Leaders’ Roundtable on Climate Action. Could you share more details with us on that?Zhao Lijian: On September 21 local time, President Xi Jinping’s Special Representative State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and addressed the Informal Leaders’ Roundtable on Climate Action at the United Nations headquarters in New York.State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that, President Xi Jinping explicitly noted that the earth is a big family and mankind is a community. Climate change is a common challenge that calls for a common response. China believes that efforts in four aspects need to be made if global climate governance goals are to be met. First, we need to channel energies into a successful UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm el Sheikh. Second, we need to attach importance to implementation action. We need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, stick to what has been agreed, and accelerate progress toward the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. China supports the Global Early Warning Initiative launched by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Developed countries need to earnestly honor their commitments and provide financial, technological and capacity-building support for developing countries. Third, we need to advance results-oriented green transformation. Fourth, we need to create a favorable political environment. We need to ditch unilateralism, geopolitical games and green barriers. Developed countries need to achieve carbon neutrality way ahead of schedule to create space for developing countries’ development, and take concrete actions to rebuild North-South trust.Wang Yi briefed the participants on a host of active measures taken by China to pursue a development path which is green and low-carbon and puts ecological conservation first. He said that China has announced its targets for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, and will achieve the largest reduction in carbon intensity the world has ever seen and move from carbon peaking to carbon neutrality within the shortest time in world history. China has made steady progress in adjusting the energy structure, leading the world in the installed capacity and generation of wind and solar power. It has also produced and sold more new-energy vehicles than any other country. China has put in place a national carbon emissions trading scheme and established carbon market that covers the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. China has increased the carbon sequestration capacity of its ecosystem, topping the world in terms of forest density increase and afforested areas. China is ready to work with all other countries to support the UN in playing a core role, practice true multilateralism, each do our part and unite our efforts to protect our home planet and create a better world for generations to come.Macau Monthly: The Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act recently passed the US House of Representatives. This bill requires the Department of State to report the use of untrusted telecommunications equipment (and services) in US diplomatic missions overseas and allies and partners. It also requires certain securities issuers to disclose the use of such equipment from entities owned or controlled by the government of China or Russia. What is China’s comment?Zhao Lijian: Heh heh. This reminds people of a revelation from a former head of the British National Cyber Security Centre not long ago. He said that after the UK government was ready to cooperate with Huawei as the company was not found to pose any national security threats in 2019, the then senior director for Asian Affairs at the US National Security Council traveled to the UK and yelled at the UK representatives for five hours to pressure the UK to abandon Huawei.The US now intends to turn its coercive and bullying practices into rules through legislation. This exactly shows that by talking about the “rules-based order”, the US politicians are simply defending the US’s own hegemonic interests. And not even “close allies” like the UK can be spared from US coercion and bullying. Such hegemonic rules clearly have undermined world peace and international cooperation, which the US apparently does not care about.We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes, stop its denigration and suppression of Chinese companies and remove the negative content about China from the bill. The Chinese government will continue to firmly defend Chinese companies’ legitimate rights and interests.Dragon TV: On September 21, the Second Middle East Security Forum was held in Beijing. Could you share more with us on that?Zhao Lijian: The Second Middle East Security Forum focuses on the Global Security Initiative (GSI) under the theme of “Building a New Security Architecture in the Middle East, Achieving Common Security for the Region”. Two parallel sessions are held, which are “Panel I: The Palestinian Question: Solutions and Prospects” and “Panel II: Persian Gulf Security: Multilateralism, Dialogue and Cooperation”.In a virtual address to the forum’s opening ceremony, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi elaborated on China’s four-point proposal for fostering a new security architecture in the Middle East, i.e. pursuing the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security; affirming the leading role of Middle East countries; observing the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; and enhancing regional security dialogue. Dr. Rami Hamdallah, former Prime Minister of Palestine and Dr. Adnan Badran, former Prime Minister of Jordan virtually attended and addressed the opening ceremony. They commended China’s GSI and efforts to help build a new security architecture in the Middle East. They also expressed the hope that China will play a bigger, constructive role in resolving hotspot issues and upholding security and stability in the region.Participants at the meeting said that the Global Security Initiative is of great significance for promoting regional peace and stability and resolving regional conflicts. They welcomed China’s proposal to build a new security architecture in the Middle East. They also expressed the hope that China will continue to uphold fairness and justice and work intensively to encourage regional parties to resolve differences through dialogue with a view to common and lasting security in the region. They stressed that countries in the region should increase their independence, improve their relations with each other and play a bigger role in building a new security architecture in the Middle East. The international community, especially major countries outside the region, should also play a positive role in realizing regional security and stability.As a sincere friend and partner of Middle East countries, China will continue to build consensus and pool strength of all parties through the Middle East Security Forum and other platforms, and make its contribution to building a new security architecture in the Middle East and realizing common security in the region.Bloomberg: Can I ask who will China send to the state funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on September 27?Zhao Lijian: China will release information in due course.AFP: President Joe Biden in his speech at the UN General Assembly yesterday said he does not wish to seek a Cold War, nor does he wish to seek a conflict with China and he also mentioned China several other times, including in relation to the UN Xinjiang report. What’s China’s response?Zhao Lijian: China’s policy on the US has shown continuity and certainty. President Xi Jinping proposed that China and the US follow the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. They not only embody the experience that China-US relations have gained over the past 50 years, but also constitute the basic principle that both sides need to follow in order to keep bilateral ties on the right course. President Biden has made the “five-noes” commitment on many occasions. We hope that the US side will act on the statements made by the US leader, view China and China-US relations from the right perspective, return to the three China-US joint communiqués, which are of fundamental importance to the bilateral relationship, handle Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly, and uphold the political foundation of China-US relations.We hope that the US will work with China to find a way for the two major countries with different social systems, histories and cultures to get along and cooperate for win-win results. This will not only benefit the people of the two countries, but also contribute to world peace, stability and development.On your second question about Xinjiang, the so-called assessment of the human rights condition in Xinjiang released by the OHCHR is orchestrated and produced by the US and some Western forces and is completely illegal, null and void. It is a patchwork of disinformation that serves as a political tool for the US and some Western forces to strategically use Xinjiang to contain China.In recent years, nearly 100 countries, including Muslim countries, have spoken out at the Human Rights Council, the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly and on other public occasions to support China’s justified position on issues including Xinjiang and oppose interference in China’s internal affairs in the name of so-called Xinjiang-related issues. They are the mainstream of the international community. The US and some Western forces seek to destabilize Xinjiang and use it to contain China. Their unjust, pernicious political agenda will not have people’s support and will only fail.The US side should face up to and address its own human rights issues such as racial discrimination, gun violence, violations of the Indigenous people’s rights, violations of immigrants’ rights, human trafficking, disinformation campaign, and indiscriminate unilateral sanctions. It should deliver a responsible account to the international community and the victims.Bloomberg: Later today in New York, there should be a meeting of the BRICS foreign ministers. Do you have any details about the agenda? What China’s expectations might be for that meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN?Zhao Lijian: We will release information in due course.Kyodo News: Tsai Ing-wen today met with a delegation of Czech Senators, and the two sides agreed to deepen their relations. What is China’s comment?Zhao Lijian: There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. The Taiwan question is China’s internal affair. It concerns China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and bears on China’s core interests. We firmly oppose all forms of official interactions between the Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China. We firmly oppose external forces’ attempt to use the Taiwan question to interfere in China’s internal affairs. The Chinese government and people have the unwavering resolve and conviction to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge the relevant Czech politicians to earnestly abide by the one-China principle, refrain from sending any wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” separatist forces, and avoid inflicting further damage on the political foundation of the development of bilateral relations.
9.23 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin’s Regular Press Conference on September 23, 2022China News Service: According to reports, the seventh China-Eurasia Expo was held in Urumqi, Xinjiang this week. Can you share with us the highlights of this expo?Wang Wenbin: From September 19 to 22, the seventh China-Eurasia Expo was held under the theme of “Extensive Consultation, Joint Contribution, Shared Benefits, Cooperation for a Shared Future” in Urumqi, Xinjiang. This year’s expo has exceeded all previous years in terms of the level of participants, the number of participating countries and the number of fruitful outcomes.President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the Expo, pointing out that the Eurasian continent is full of vitality and potential for development and is a key region for international Belt and Road cooperation. In recent years, China’s Xinjiang has given full play to its geographical advantages to actively develop the core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt and promote the interconnectivity, mutually beneficial cooperation and common development between China and Eurasian countries. The efforts have achieved positive results. Leaders addressed the opening ceremony through video messages. They include President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary representing guest countries of honor, Prime Minster Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan, dignitaries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Mongolia, Secretary-General of ASEAN Lim Jock Hoi and Secretary General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Zhang Ming.The expo attracted 3,597 companies from 32 countries and regions which participated online, including 2,652 companies which participated as online exhibitors. Up to 21 Global Fortune 500 companies and multinational corporations from China and other countries attended the expo, and 110 industry leaders participated as offline exhibitors. So far, 448 deals worth over 1.17 trillion yuan have been signed, higher than what was achieved in previous expos.Through its five points of entry, Xinjiang is linked to eight countries. The Silk Road connects Xinjiang with the rest of Eurasia. As a core area of the Silk Road Economic Belt, Xinjiang is sharing its development vitality with other areas with open arms. China is ready to work with other countries to harness the China-Eurasia Expo, uphold the Silk Road spirit of peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit, stay committed to high-standard, people-centered and sustainable cooperation, expand cooperation areas with Eurasia, upgrade the level of Eurasia cooperation and promote common development and prosperity.AFP: A Cambodian official told AFP that more than 20 Chinese nationals are missing after a boat carrying 41 capsized off the coast near Sihanoukville yesterday. Is China able to confirm this and provide more details?Wang Wenbin: China and Cambodia are in close communication over this. We have asked the Cambodian side to make all-out search and rescue efforts. We are doing everything we can to find out more about the details of the incident and verify them as quickly as we can.CCTV: According to reports, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech at the headquarters of Asia Society in New York on September 22. Can you share some information?Wang Wenbin: On September 22 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech at the headquarters of Asia Society in New York. State Councilor Wang Yi pointed out that, the past few years have seen China-US relations at a low ebb since the establishment of diplomatic ties. This is bringing tremendous uncertainty to the future of our peoples and to countries across the world. It boils down to how the United States perceives China, the world and itself. Be it full confrontation or strategic competition, both have deviated from the right course of China-US relations. Regarding the right way for China and the US to get on with each other, President Xi Jinping has given a clear answer. That is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. These three principles are an important conclusion informed by the evolution of China-US relations over the past 50-odd years. They are also the right way for major countries to live with each other in this era.State Councilor Wang Yi said, that China and the US need to respect each other is an important lesson drawn from past exchanges between our two countries, and also a basic prerequisite for the bilateral ties to return to the right track. China respects the development path chosen by the American people. We welcome an open and confident United States that enjoys growth and progress. The US should also respect the Chinese people’s choice of development path, i.e., socialism with Chinese characteristics. China will unswervingly follow its chosen path and direction, and will forge ahead steadily along this path toward greater success. China will continue to draw upon the valuable experience of other countries and achievements of all civilizations, embrace the world with open arms and open its door even wider.Partner or rival? Cooperation or confrontation? These are questions of fundamental importance in China-US relations, and no catastrophic mistakes could be made, State Councilor Wang Yi noted. China chooses peace and commits to peaceful development. Our most basic expectation for China-US relations is for the two countries to live with each other in peace. Expansion, coercion and hegemony are never in the veins of the Chinese people. Today’s China is built on the heritage of ancient China. The CPC, China’s governing party, has incorporated peaceful development into its constitution, and China is the only major country that has codified peaceful development in the Constitution. Some in the US try to take China down by repeating the containment tactic used on the former Soviet Union, and hope to encircle China through geopolitical maneuvering like the Indo-Pacific strategy. Such attempts will only prove futile.State Councilor Wang Yi said, win-win cooperation is not only possible, but also a must. This is the true narrative of China-US relations in the past half a century, and it should remain the goal we both pursue. As the world’s largest developing and developed countries, China and the United States have a lot to offer each other. We enjoy broad room for cooperation in a wide range of areas covering economy and trade, energy, science and technology, education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges. We shoulder important responsibilities in addressing global issues like COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, terrorism, proliferation and regional hotspots. An unfailing truth in China-US interactions is that we both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is our best choice. Undeniably, China and the US have competition in areas like economy and trade, and China does not fear such competition. However, we do not agree that China-US relations should be simply defined by competition, because this is not the entirety or the mainstream of this relationship. At the same time, competition should have boundaries and, more importantly, be fair play. We need healthy competition that brings out the best in each other, not vicious competition that aims at each other’s demise.State Councilor Wang Yi stressed that the one-China principle is the cornerstone of the political foundation for China-US relations; the three China-US joint communiqués are the most crucial “guardrails” for our relations. As things stand, the Taiwan question is growing into the biggest risk in China-US relations. Should it be mishandled, it is most likely to devastate our bilateral ties. Just as the US will not allow Hawaii to be split away, China has the right to uphold the unification of the country as Taiwan is part of China. Since the Government of the People’s Republic of China is recognized as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, Taiwan should not be allowed to join any international organization with sovereign implications. If one recognizes the one-China principle, one should not engage in any official interactions with Taiwan. The logic here cannot be simpler. The Taiwan question arose as a result of weakness and chaos in the nation, and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality. Reunification is the trend of history and the aspiration of the people. The US should choose to stand on the right side of history.It is our hope that China and the US will draw on past experience to find inspiration for the present, and gain strength for going forward. Together, let us explore a way to a China-US relationship for the new era and create a better future for both of our countries!Bloomberg: You talked just now on your comments about the need for greater cooperation between the US and China, yet at the same time there are eight areas which were recently cut or stopped by the Chinese side. So I’m just trying to understand whether we can expect a resumption in talks between the two countries on those areas if we are to pave the way to greater cooperation between the US and China?Wang Wenbin: We have made our response clear to the question you asked multiple times. It is the US that violated China’s sovereignty first, and China was compelled to take legitimate countermeasures. Our countermeasures are fully legitimate, justified and lawful. If the US wants to seek cooperation with China, it needs to respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and take concrete measures to match its commitment to the one-China principle.Beijing Daily: On September 22, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said when hosting the first Ministerial Meeting of the Partners in the Blue Pacific on the margins of the UNGA that the US is deeply committed to the Pacific. In a briefing to reporters after the meeting, Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs in the US National Security Council Kurt Campbell said that China’s ambitions in the Pacific are a concern for some Pacific Island leaders. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: We welcome the US’s expressed desire to give Pacific Island Countries (PICs) more development support. We hope the US can match its words with actions.What the PICs need is mutually beneficial cooperation based on equality, not self-serving expediency driven by geopolitical calculations. The PICs have the right to independently conduct exchanges with other countries. Their right should be respected and not restricted or denied.China upholds the principles of equal treatment, mutual respect, win-win cooperation and openness and inclusiveness in developing relations with the PICs. This has been welcomed and supported by the PICs. China stands ready to work with all parties in the spirit of openness, transparency, opening-up and inclusiveness to jointly promote the development and prosperity of the PICs.O Globo: Can you give us some details of what was discussed at the meeting of the BRICS foreign ministers in New York last night and how China sees the role of the group in the resolution of the Ukraine conflict?Wang Wenbin: As representatives of emerging markets and developing countries, BRICS countries are committed to defending multilateralism and opposed to hegemony and bullying and champion stronger solidarity and coordination for world peace and development.As to the details about the BRICS foreign ministers’ meeting on the margins of UNGA in New York, we will release information in due course. Please check back for updates.Bloomberg: UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres recently expressed concern over plans to hold referendums in parts of Ukraine that are under Russian control. He said that any annexation of a state’s territory by another state resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the UN Charter and international law. Does the Chinese foreign ministry have any comment on this?Wang Wenbin: We’ve made clear our position on the Ukraine issue on multiple occasions. We believe that all countries deserve respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed, that the legitimate security concerns of any country should be taken seriously, and that support should be given to all efforts that are conducive to peacefully resolving the crisis. We call on the parties concerned to properly address differences through dialogue and consultation. China stands ready to work with members of the international community to continue to play a constructive part in deescalation efforts.Kyodo News: Yesterday, a Japanese official said that Wan Gang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), will attend the state funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. What will this trip mean for China-Japan relations?Wang Wenbin: At the invitation of the Japanese side, Wan Gang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), will attend the funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as the representative of the Chinese government.You mentioned China-Japan relations. Let me say that China and Japan are each other’s neighbors and both important countries in the region. To maintain and develop friendly and cooperative relations between China and Japan serves the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples. As a responsible major country, China has made contributions to regional and world peace, stability and prosperity, which is witnessed by all. We hope that Japan will abide by the principles set out in the four China-Japan political documents, work with China in the same direction and jointly build a China-Japan relationship that meets the needs of the new era.Bloomberg: US President Joe Biden reaffirmed the US’s iron-clad commitment to the defense of the Philippines in the meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos. The two leaders also underscored their support for the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea and said they sought peaceful resolution of disputes. Does the Chinese foreign ministry have any comment on US President Joe Biden’s words on the defense of the Philippines?Wang Wenbin: There has been no problem with freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. China always respects and supports the freedom of navigation and overflight enjoyed by all countries in the South China Sea in accordance with international law. China will continue to properly handle maritime disputes with countries directly concerned, including the Philippines, through dialogue and consultation, and work with ASEAN countries to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea. We hope that countries outside the region will earnestly respect the efforts of countries in the region to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.CCTV: German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement released on September 22 that in their meeting, the G7 Foreign Ministers and the High Representative of the European Union said that they opposed unilateral changes to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and that there is no change in the basic positions of G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. Taiwan is part of China’s territory. China’s state sovereignty and territorial integrity has never been split. This is the status quo in the Taiwan Strait and one China is at the heart of this status quo. The one who is trying to change the status quo is not China, but rather the DPP authorities and the external meddling forces who have been emboldening “Taiwan independence” separatist elements. The one-China principle is what underpins peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The clearer and stronger the commitment of the international community is to the one-China principle, the more likely peace across the Taiwan Strait will be ensured. We hope Germany and other G7 members will not only unequivocally commit to the one-China principle, but also follow the principle with concrete actions.
9.26 CCTV: State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a statement at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 24. Could you share more information on that?Wang Wenbin: On September 24 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended and addressed the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York. He put forward a series of propositions on the current international landscape and joint efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind, which can be summarized as the following “six dos and six don’ts”:First, we must uphold peace and oppose war and turbulence. We should remain committed to addressing differences through peaceful means and resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation.Second, we must pursue development and eliminate poverty. We should place development at the center of the international agenda and see that everyone in every country benefits more from the fruits of development in a more equitable way.Third, we must remain open and oppose exclusion. We should stay true to openness and inclusiveness, uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and endeavor to build an open world economy.Fourth, we must stay engaged in cooperation and oppose confrontation. We should engage in dialogue, consultation and win-win cooperation, and reject conflict, coercion and zero-sum game. We should jointly oppose group politics and bloc confrontation.Fifth, we must strengthen solidarity and oppose division. We should stand against drawing lines on ideological grounds and work together to expand common ground and convergence of interests to promote world peace and development.Sixth, we must uphold equity and oppose bullying. We should promote and practice true multilateralism, promote equality of all countries in terms of rights, rules and opportunities, and build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, equity and justice, and win-win cooperation.State Councilor Wang Yi said that in response to various challenges, President Xi Jinping proposed the Global Development Initiative, which is a rallying call to refocus attention on development and build a global community of development. President Xi Jinping also proposed the Global Security Initiative, contributing China’s vision to reducing the peace deficit and providing China’s input to meeting global security challenges.State Councilor Wang Yi stressed that the one-China principle has become a basic norm in international relations and a general consensus of the international community. China will continue to endeavor to achieve peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and greatest efforts. To realize this goal, we must combat “Taiwan independence” separatist activities with the firmest resolve and take the most forceful steps to repulse interference by external groups. Only by resolutely forestalling in accordance with the law separatist activities can we forge a true foundation for peaceful reunification. Only when China is completely reunified can there be enduring peace across the Taiwan Strait. Any scheme to interfere in China’s internal affairs is bound to meet the strong opposition of all us Chinese, and any move to obstruct China’s cause of reunification is bound to be crushed by the wheels of history.State Councilor Wang Yi pointed out that as China has one-fifth of the global population, its march toward modernization has important, far-reaching significance for the world. The upcoming 20th National Congress of the CPC will, in response to the expectation of all the Chinese people, set well-conceived goals and tasks for China’s development in the next five years and beyond, and it will draw an overarching plan for China’s future development. Having reached a new historical starting point, China will follow the Chinese path to modernization to achieve the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. China will work with other countries to make every effort for peace and development, shoulder the responsibility for solidarity and progress, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and embrace an even better world.Bloomberg: President Zelenskyy of Ukraine has claimed that there are fewer communication channels between Ukraine and China compared to before. Specifically, he’s talking about leader-to-leader level communication. Could you tell us the reasons for that?Wang Wenbin: China and Ukraine are strategic partners. Since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30 years ago, cooperation in various fields between China and Ukraine has made good progress and exchanges at all levels have been smooth. Our two countries have also conducted active cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. Last year, bilateral trade hit $19.3 billion, up by 29.7% year-on-year. Cooperation in such areas as agriculture, infrastructure and COVID-19 response has proceeded smoothly. China stands ready to work with Ukraine to maintain the momentum in our cooperation and continue to enrich the China-Ukraine strategic partnership.China’s position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We always follow an objective and fair approach, stand for peace and will continue to play a constructive part in deescalation efforts in our own way.MASTV: State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced when addressing the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 24 that China has decided to launch its domestic procedure to ratify the UN’s Firearms Protocol. Can you share the consideration behind this?Wang Wenbin: The Firearms Protocol is one of the important protocols supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and an important legal instrument in the field of small arms and light weapons. On September 24, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced when addressing the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly that China has decided to launch its domestic procedure to ratify the UN’s Firearms Protocol. This is an important step taken by China to actively implement the Global Security Initiative and uphold international and regional peace and stability. It embodies China’s determination to support multilateralism and build a community with a shared future for mankind. China is fulfilling the domestic legal procedure in accordance with relevant provisions and will endeavor to ratify the Protocol at an early date.Gun proliferation is a global threat. The illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms not only causes massive civilian casualties, but also leads to significant spillovers that exacerbate regional instability and fuel terrorism and transnational organized crime. The global gun control deficit calls for prompt resolution, which particularly calls for global cooperation and joint response.The Chinese government takes the issue of gun control seriously and firmly opposes the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms. After years of hard work, China has become one of the safest countries in the world with the fewest violent gun crimes. China strictly implements military export control, earnestly fulfills its international obligations, and actively conducts international exchanges and cooperation, which is internationally recognized. China is ready to take the ratification of the Firearms Protocol as an opportunity to further strengthen exchanges and cooperation with all parties, work together to address the issue of global gun proliferation, and make contributions to international and regional peace and security.Yonhap News Agency: According to reports, the DPRK fired a ballistic missile off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula on September 25. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: We have noted relevant foreign media reports. We have also taken note that the US and others have conducted multiple joint military exercises in this region recently. The crux of the current situation on the Korean Peninsula is that the legitimate and reasonable security concerns of the DPRK have not been duly responded to. We hope that all parties concerned on the issue of the Korean Peninsula will keep to the direction of seeking political settlement and address each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation. The US needs to step up to its own responsibility, stop confrontational and pressuring moves, and create conditions for resuming meaningful dialogue.Xinhua News Agency: In an address at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly on September 23, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said that Solomon Islands has been subjected to a barrage of unwarranted and misplaced criticisms in the media since formalizing diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. He also called on all countries not to inflame tensions in the Taiwan Strait and its neighboring areas. “Any miscalculation could threaten international peace and security and could have disastrous consequences on global trade,” he said. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: Prime Minister Sogavare’s compelling statement is a firm rejection of the groundless criticisms and accusations against the relations between China and Solomon Islands. He defended the two countries’ legitimate right to normal exchanges and cooperation and spoke out for justice regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait and the situation in the region and around the world. China highly commends his statement.During the General Debate of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly, many countries reaffirmed their commitment to the one-China principle. This once again shows that the one-China principle is a prevailing consensus of the international community and a basic norm in international relations.China is committed to growing friendly cooperative ties with Solomon Islands in line with the principles of mutual respect, equality, win-win results and openness and inclusiveness. We will always remain a good friend and partner whom Solomon Islands can trust and support the country as always in pursuing an independent development path that suits its national reality.Associated Press of Pakistan: According to reports, a ceremony of the donation for flood relief titled “Chinese People for Pakistani Brothers and Sisters” was held in Beijing on Sunday. Can you share some information about it here?Wang Wenbin: The event was co-hosted by the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), the China-Pakistan Friendship Association, and the China Friendship Foundation for Peace and Development. The event raised 125 million yuan worth of donations and flood-relief supplies. Some of the supplies have been delivered to the flood-stricken areas.China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners and ironclad brothers that have always stood with each other in trying times. Since Pakistan was hit by the floods, the Chinese side, feeling deeply for our Pakistani brothers and sisters, has taken prompt actions to help. The Chinese government has provided 400 million yuan worth of humanitarian assistance to Pakistan. The civil society in China has also extended a helping hand. The CPAFFC worked immediately to encourage and organize the friendship associations of Chinese cities with sister city relationships with Pakistani cities and Chinese enterprises, institutions and philanthropists, among others, to take part in the fundraiser. The event received broad support from the civil society, with the participation of 18 cities with sister city relationships with Pakistani cities, 24 friendship organizations and subnational friendship associations, 13 companies and several hundred charitable individuals from 15 Chinese provinces and municipalities. Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque said at the event that the exceptional amount of donation indeed is very generous and timely and would be immensely helpful in reinforcing Pakistan’s ongoing flood-relief efforts.The Chinese government and people will continue to stand with Pakistan. We believe that our brotherly Pakistan will surely prevail over the disaster and rebuild their homes at an early date.Reuters: Voting in referendums in Ukraine aimed at annexing territory to Russia enters the 4th day on Monday. Does China recognize these referendums in the four eastern Ukraine regions?Wang Wenbin: I replied to a related question last week. Let me refer you to that.Phoenix TV: According to reports, leaders of many countries including Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Bolivian President Luis Arce and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla have all condemned the US’s hegemonic acts of imposing unilateral sanctions in their statements at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. What’s China’s comment?Wang Wenbin: We have noted relevant reports. The US is no doubt the superpower of sanctions. Figures show an increase of 933% in sanctions imposed by the US from 2000 to 2021. To date, the US has imposed economic sanctions on nearly 40 countries, which have affected almost half of the global population and caused serious humanitarian disasters. The previous US administration issued a total of over 3,900 sanction measures, which means the US wields its sanctions stick three times a day on average. According to US media, sanctions have become the US’s foreign policy weapon of choice.Over the past decades, the US has imposed unilateral sanctions on countries including Cuba, Belarus, Syria and Zimbabwe and ratcheted up “maximum pressure” on countries like the DPRK, Iran and Venezuela. Such action is against the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and norms of international law. It deals a heavy blow to the international political and economic order and the global governance system, and seriously disrupts the sanctioned countries’ efforts to mobilize resources, grow the economy and improve people’s wellbeing. It endangers the right to life, challenges the right to self-determination, undermines the right to development, and constitutes a persistent, systemic and large-scale violation of human rights.The US is now experiencing the highest inflation rate in four decades. Soaring domestic prices have placed a heavy burden on the American people. In today’s globalized world, US policymakers need to seriously reflect on how indiscriminate unilateral sanctions are backfiring on the US itself and stop doing things that harm others and oneself alike.To embrace cooperation, not confrontation, pursue multilateralism, not unilateralism, and uphold solidarity, not division, is the prevailing consensus of the international community. The US needs to listen to the just call of the international community, stop its hegemonic act of wantonly slapping unilateral sanctions and play a constructive role in promoting world peace and development.Kyodo News: Reports said that China and the DPRK have resumed cross-border freight train services. Can you confirm that?Wang Wenbin: In accordance with relevant border-related agreements and after friendly consultations, China and the DPRK have recently decided to resume the cross-border rail freight transport between Dandong and Sinuiju. The two sides will continue to step up coordination and cooperation, actively ensure the safe and stable operation of the freight train and contribute to the growth of China-DPRK friendly relations.ANZA: Italy just held its general elections last weekend. The center-right coalition is going to get a solid majority. The leader of Brothers of Italy Giorgia Meloni, who is expected to be the next Italian Prime Minister, criticized China a few days ago on some kind of policies, for example, the ones related to Taiwan. What are the Chinese expectations about bilateral relations?Wang Wenbin: We have noted what came of Italy’s parliamentary election. China and Italy are comprehensive strategic partners. A sound and steady development of bilateral relations meets the shared interest of both sides. We hope the new Italian government will continue to follow a positive and practical China policy, work with China, uphold the spirit of mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual benefit and keep deepening bilateral cooperation and people-to-people exchange in various areas for the benefit of the two countries and the two peoples.The Taiwan question is purely China’s internal affair, which brooks no foreign interference. The one-China principle is an established international consensus and a basic norm of international relations. It is the political prerequisite and foundation for Italy and other countries to establish and develop diplomatic relations with China. China urges certain individuals in Italy to fully recognize the highly sensitive nature of the Taiwan question, earnestly abide by the one-China principle, and avoid sending wrong signals to the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.The Paper: The Stanford Internet Observatory recently released a report disclosing how the US spreads disinformation targeting specific countries and regions including China on social media platforms to sway international public opinion and manipulate people’s perceptions and narratives. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: I noted the report revealed that over the years, the US has put in place a huge propaganda network targeting countries including China, Russia and Iran on social media platforms. Through this network, the US has launched political propaganda and rumor-mongering campaigns by creating fake personas, sharing similar contents and hyping up specific topics. I have also noted that multiple US media outlets have recently revealed that these sham accounts are suspected to be managed and run by the US military with the aim of staging covert information wars.From Operation Mockingbird which bribed and manipulated news media for propaganda purposes in the Cold War era, to a vial with white powder and a staged video of the “White Helmets” cited as evidence to wage wars in Iraq and Syria earlier this century, and then to the false allegations of “genocide” and “forced labor” in Xinjiang in recent years, the US keeps fabricating and spreading disinformation to glorify aggression and interference as promoting democracy, plundering as upholding justice, and devastation and killing as protecting human rights.What is particularly ironic is that the US, being the largest disinformation propagator, has constantly labeled other countries and slung mud at them. The US is the one who has created a colossal number of sham accounts, yet it keeps asking social media platforms to remove the accounts of Chinese users. The US is the one who has manipulated public opinion, yet it keeps labeling Chinese media outlets as “state-affiliated” accounts. The US is the one who has applied a gloomy filter to paint China in a negative light, yet it keeps accusing China of turning public sentiment against the US.Perhaps some in the US believe that if they spread enough rumors, they will win the information war. However, people of the world are clear-eyed and will not be fooled. Be it alleged WMDs in Iraq, the “White Helmets” in Syria or “genocide” in Xinjiang, they have all become synonyms for the US’s failing credibility. The various disinformation spread by the US is being seen through by more and more people around the world and will only be rejected by the world just like US hegemony.
9.27 China News Service: State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently held meetings with more than ten European leaders and foreign ministers on the sidelines of the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: During the UNGA high-level week, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with leaders, political dignitaries and foreign ministers of European countries including Serbia, France, Malta, the UK, Portugal, Norway, Poland, Hungary and Germany, and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. They had extensive, in-depth and candid talks on enhancing mutual understanding, advancing practical cooperation and jointly responding to challenges, which fully shows the importance China attaches to China-EU relations.State Councilor Wang underscored the need for China and the EU, two major forces in a multi-polar world, to stick to the characterization of the two sides as each other’s strategic partners, and maintain the sound momentum of dialogue and communication. He expressed China’s confidence that the EU will uphold strategic autonomy and work with China to promote the steady and sustained growth of bilateral relations. His European counterparts said they value relations with China, reiterated commitment to the one-China policy and expressed the hope of having candid exchanges and deeper cooperation in relevant fields.Dialogue and cooperation remains the mainstream of China-EU relations. Mutual benefit is the underlying tone of China’s cooperation with Europe. For the first eight months of this year, China-EU trade increased by 8.8% year-on-year and EU investment in China went up by 123.7%. The China-Europe Railway Express made its 10,000th trip of this year 10 days sooner than last year. The two sides made good progress or reached agreements on macroeconomic policy coordination, supply and industrial chain cooperation, WTO reform, greater market access, implementation of the China-EU agreement on geographical indications, animal and plant inspection and quarantine, and two-way opening-up of the financial sector and regulatory cooperation. All these speak to the vibrancy and resilience of China-EU cooperation.China hopes to work with the EU to be two major forces for world peace, two big markets for common development and two great civilizations for human progress and together pursue mutual benefit, uphold multilateralism and seek common ground while reserving differences. By working together, we can bring about the sound and steady growth of China-EU relations, contribute to the sustained recovery of the world economy and bring certainty and hope to a turbulent and volatile world.China Daily: US Vice President Kamala Harris met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo. They discussed China’s recent aggressive and irresponsible provocations in the Taiwan Strait, and reaffirmed the importance of preserving peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Do you have any comment on this?Wang Wenbin: The US House Speaker, in disregard of China’s four-month-long dissuasion, made a provocative visit to China’s Taiwan region and referred to Taiwan as a “country”. What the US side has done seriously violates China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, hurts China-US relations and undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. As a response, China took countermeasures that are legitimate, lawful, proportionate and necessary.What constitute the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait at the moment are the DPP authorities’ provocations aimed at “Taiwan independence” and the connivance and support they have received from external forces. The one-China principle is what underpins peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The clearer and stronger the commitment of the international community is to the one-China principle, the more likely peace across the Taiwan Strait will be ensured. We urge the US side to return to the three China-US Joint Communiqués and the one-China principle in their true and original form, reaffirm its commitment to the one-China policy in the simple and straightforward way, and state its opposition to all “Taiwan independence” separatist activities with absolute clarity.AFP: Former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Taiwan today. Do you have a comment on this?Wang Wenbin: You mentioned a former politician of diminished credibility who staged these stunts for personal political gains. His calculations will not materialize.Dragon TV: According to reports, the temporary ceasefire agreement between warring parties in Yemen is set to expire on October 2. Recently, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) reaffirmed their support for the resolution of the Yemen issue through political means and for the UN-led peace efforts. They also called on the Houthis to cooperate with the UN’s mediation efforts and reach an agreement on renewing the ceasefire deal at an early date. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: China takes seriously and fully understands the legitimate and reasonable concerns of the GCC countries over the Yemen issue. We support the GCC countries’ effort in safeguarding their security and support their initiatives and propositions on resolving the Yemen issue. We oppose all attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure in the GCC countries and actions that violate the temporary ceasefire agreement. China hopes that parties concerned will actively assist the UN’s mediation efforts, reach an agreement on the renewal of the deal as soon as possible, help turn the temporary ceasefire into a permanent one and toward a sustainable political solution, and work for the early return of peace, stability and order to Yemen.Beijing Youth Daily: It is reported that at least 17 people, including 11 students, were killed in a shooting at a school in Izhevsk, the capital city of Russia’s Udmurt Republic on September 26. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant reports. We express our condolences for the victims and sympathies to the bereaved families and the wounded.AFP: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on Pakistan to seek debt relief from China so that Pakistan can more quickly recover from the floods. Is China planning any debt relief for Pakistan?Wang Wenbin: Since the floods hit the country, China has rushed to Pakistan’s aid as its genuine friend and brother in times of need. The Chinese government has provided 400 million RMB worth of humanitarian assistance and China’s civil society has also lent a helping hand. We will continue to do our utmost to help the Pakistani people overcome the floods and rebuild their homes at an early date.China and Pakistan have had fruitful economic and financial cooperation. The Pakistani people know it best. Instead of passing unwarranted criticism against China-Pakistan cooperation, the US side might as well do something real and beneficial for the people of Pakistan.NHK: The UN Security Council held an urgent meeting on the referendums on joining Russia in eastern and southern Ukraine. What is China’s position on this?Wang Wenbin: Let me first reiterate China’s long-standing position that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed, that the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises must be supported. On the Ukraine issue, China always stands on the side of peace and has been committed to promoting peace talks. We are ready to work with the international community and continue to play a constructive part in deescalating the situation.The Security Council, as the core of the international collective security mechanism, needs to make full use of the mediation tools provided for in the UN Charter and steer the situation in the right direction of ending the fighting and promoting dialogue. The Council needs to take constructive and responsible actions in particular to accumulate conditions and open up space for a political resolution.AFP: A question on the United Nations. The US and some Western countries presented a proposal on Monday asking the UN human rights body to hold a special debate over the situation in Xinjiang. What do you think about this proposal?Wang Wenbin: The Xinjiang-related issues are not about ethnicity, religion or human rights. They are about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism and have everything to do with protecting China’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and national security. A handful of countries have tried to use Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs, discredit China and contain and hinder China’s development. Their political calculations will not succeed.Certain Western countries use the Human Rights Council as a tool for political manipulation. They blatantly apply double standard and have gone so far as to name and shame some developing countries and openly pressure them. This has poisoned the atmosphere and led to aggravated confrontation at the Human Rights Council, which is detrimental to international human rights cooperation. The international community firmly rejects such practices.The US and a few others, oblivious to their own serious human rights violations, are obsessed with lecturing and criticizing other countries, which has become a source of ridicule in the eyes of the world. We urge these few Western countries to take a hard look at themselves, reflect on and address their serious human rights issues including racial discrimination, gun violence, infringement on indigenous people’s rights and abuse of unilateral sanctions, and fulfill their human rights obligations with concrete actions.CCTV: On September 26, Pakistan delivered a joint statement on behalf of nearly 70 countries at the 51st session of the Human Rights Council, expressing support for China’s position on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet and opposition to interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. What’s China’s comment?Wang Wenbin: Yesterday, Pakistan delivered a joint statement on behalf of nearly 70 countries at the 51st session of the Human Rights Council. The statement pointed out that Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet related issues are China’s internal affairs and expressed opposition to politicization of human rights and double standard, or interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. It called on all parties to abide by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and respect the right of the people of each state to choose independently the path for development in accordance with their national conditions. It also stressed that the international community should uphold multilateralism, strengthen solidarity and coordination, and respond jointly to global challenges, advance world peace and development, and promote and protect human rights. More than 20 countries voiced support for China by making their separate statements or other means.Nearly 100 countries have expressed their understanding and support for China’s legitimate position in various ways at the Human Rights Council. The attempts of a handful of Western countries to use so-called human rights issues to attack and smear China have failed time and again. This speaks volumes about who enjoys broad support and who doesn’t.A handful of Western countries have blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of human rights and repeatedly applied double standard on the issue of human rights. The overwhelming majority of the international community have long been clear-eyed about this.There are serious human rights problems within the US and a handful of other Western countries - gun violence that deprives people of the right to life, botched COVID response that denies people their right to health, human trafficking and ensuing forced labor that breach labor rights, forcible separation of migrant families against their human rights, systemic racial discrimination that infringes upon the human rights of minorities like Asian Americans, African Americans and Muslims, a persistent remnant of genocide policy that violates the human rights of the indigenous people and overseas military operations and illegal unilateral sanctions that infringe upon the human rights of other countries. We urge these countries to stop lecturing other countries on human rights and stop applying double standard and seeking political manipulation. They need to be held accountable for the human cost and catch up on their human rights record.China is unwavering in its resolve to uphold its national sovereignty, security and development interests. Whatever political theatrics these small number of Western countries perform, they will not stop the Chinese people’s journey toward greater development and progress and their calculations will all end in failure.Kyodo News: The state funeral for Japan’s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was held today in Japan. Besides the representative of the Chinese side, the representative of the Taiwan region was also invited to lay flowers at the funeral. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The one-China principle is a widely accepted norm governing international relations and a prevailing consensus of the international community. Japan needs to observe the principles set out in the four China-Japan political documents and the solemn commitments it has made, handle the relevant matters in strict accordance with the one-Chine principle and refrain from providing any platform or opportunity for “Taiwan independence” separatist forces to engage in political manipulation.
9.28 CCTV: It is reported that a seminar themed on “The People-Centered Philosophy, the Value Adherence of the Contemporary Chinese Perspective of Human Rights” was recently held in an online-plus-offline format. Chinese and foreign experts had discussions on China’s perspective on human rights at the event. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: The seminar you mentioned is a side event of the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council. It is themed on “The People-Centered Philosophy, the Value Adherence of the Contemporary Chinese Perspective of Human Rights”. Experts and scholars from China, Russia, the US, Spain, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and other countries had discussions and exchanges by sharing their personal experiences. The participants believed that China’s perspective on human rights reflects the people-centered approach. China has made unremitting efforts to protect its people’s rights to subsistence and development and to safeguard collective human rights, which embodies the values of fairness, justice and equality. In particular, China’s achievements in poverty alleviation provide useful experience for countries that have yet to lift themselves out of poverty and contribute to the world human rights cause.To protect the life, value and dignity of every individual and realize the enjoyment of human rights by all is humanity’s common pursuit. Since its founding, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has rallied and led the Chinese people in fighting for, respecting, protecting and developing human rights, and successfully found a path of human rights development that conforms to the trend of the times and suits China’s realities. The CPC always puts the people’s rights first and works to ensure the people’s right to equal participation and development, delivers the benefit of reform and development to all the people in a more equitable manner, and keeps improving its efforts to better respect and protect the basic rights of the Chinese people. We adhere to the philosophy of people-centered development, and prioritize the people’s rights to subsistence and development. Development is about improving the well-being of the people, ensuring that the people are true masters of the country, and realizing the well-rounded development of the people. China advances human rights through development. We are committed to the all-round development of human rights cause.All countries deserve the right to independently choose their own path of advancing human rights. Different civilizations and countries need to respect, accommodate, interact with and learn from each other. Human rights protection is an ongoing process. China will continue to work with the international community to promote the common values of humanity, stay committed to the vision of equality, mutual trust, inclusiveness, mutual learning, win-win cooperation and common development, and steer global human rights governance toward greater fairness, justice, equity and inclusiveness.Reuters: US Vice President Kamala Harris said in a speech today that Washington will continue to deepen its unofficial ties with Taiwan. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Wang Wenbin: I noted that Vice President Kamala Harris also said in Japan that China is undermining the international rules-based order.Let me stress first that the US House Speaker, in disregard of China’s four-month-long dissuasion, made a provocative visit to China’s Taiwan region and referred to Taiwan as a “country”. This has seriously violated China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, hampered China-US relations and undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.The one-China principle is a prevailing consensus in the international community and a basic norm in international relations. It is also the political foundation for the establishment and development of diplomatic ties between China and the US. In the Shanghai Communiqué of 1972, the China-US Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations of 1978 and the August 17 Communiqué of 1982, the US made clear that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China and that the US recognizes the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China. The US also stated clearly that it has no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, or interfering in China’s internal affairs, or pursuing a policy of “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.Speaking of rules, keeping one’s commitment is the most basic rule. If the US cannot even keep its own word, in what position is it to talk about rules and order? A country like that could only become a disruptor of international rules. We urge the US to faithfully honor its commitments and return to the three China-US Joint Communiqués and the one-China principle in their true and original form, reaffirm its commitment to the one-China policy in the simple and straightforward way, and state its opposition to all “Taiwan independence” separatist activities with absolute clarity.AFP: China told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that Ukraine’s territorial integrity should be respected, stopping short of explicitly condemning Russia. Why? Will this send a wrong signal to separatists in other parts of the world, especially in the Taiwan region?Wang Wenbin: Let me first reiterate China’s consistent and clear position on the Ukraine issue. We believe that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter must be observed, that the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously, and that all efforts conducive to peaceful settlement of the crisis must be supported. As a responsible major country, China has all along been committed to promoting peace talks. We are never a bystander, and we would never add fuel to the fire, still less exploit the crisis. We will always stand on the side of peace and will continue to play a constructive part in deescalating the situation.Turning to your question, I need to stress that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory and the Taiwan question is purely China’s internal affair. The Taiwan question and the Ukraine issue are different in nature and are not comparable at all. The future of Taiwan can only be jointly decided by all Chinese people including our compatriots in Taiwan.Anyone who seeks to insinuate relevance of the Ukraine issue to the Taiwan question is invariably driven by political calculations. Such insinuation would constitute a violation of the principle of respecting a country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and serious interference in China’s internal affairs. Anyone hoping to exploit the Ukraine issue and find a pretext for “Taiwan independence” will only end up nowhere.China Daily: Markus Potzel, the UN Secretary-General’s Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan said at the UN Security Council on September 27 that since the Taliban came into power, positive developments have been too few and too slow and are outweighed by the negatives, and patience is running out by many in the international community regarding a strategy of engagement with the Afghan Taliban. Does China agree with this assessment? What do you think of the Afghan Taliban’s governance?Wang Wenbin: Since the situation in Afghanistan went through a fundamental shift in August last year, with the concerted efforts of the international community and the interim government of Afghanistan, a refugee crisis has been averted, social order has gradually improved, the process of peace and reconstruction is being advanced, and the overall situation has remained stable. This needs to be noted by the international community. That being said, Afghanistan is at a crucial stage of moving from chaos to stability. Life is still hard in the country. The threat of terrorism is still there. Much remains to be done to improve the country’s governance. The world has expressed both expectations and concerns for the country. The international community needs to continue to engage with the Afghan interim government, ramp up humanitarian and development aid, encourage and support Afghan efforts to establish a broad-based and inclusive government, adopt moderate and prudent policies, grow friendly ties with its neighbors, protect the fundamental rights of all Afghan people, including all ethnic groups, women and children, firmly combat terrorism in all forms and realize lasting peace and security in Afghanistan at an early date.The Paper: Yesterday, China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center released a new investigation report on the cyber attacks by the US National Security Agency (NSA). The report detailed how the NSA’s Office of Tailored Access Operation (TAO) controls key infrastructure facilities in China and infiltrates into China’s Northwestern Polytechnical University’s internal network by using servers in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark to host cyber weapons through stepping-stone attack via Japan, Germany, the ROK and other countries. This enabled the TAO to steal sensitive data including user names and passwords, identification verification data, system logs, access information, files and documents, and network configuration, and information of people with sensitive identities. The US also secretly controls the telecom carriers of at least 80 countries and conducts indiscriminate wiretapping on global telecom users. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: This is the third investigation report issued by the relevant Chinese institution this month on the US National Security Agency’s malicious cyber attack on China’s Northwestern Polytechnical University. It has revealed more evidence of massive cyber attacks by the US security agency against China.China has in recent weeks demanded an explanation from the US and asked it to immediately stop illegal action through various channels. So far, however, the US has been silent. The US could not have been more bombastic and motivated when propagating the lies about “Chinese hackers”, yet it has deliberately chosen to be blind and mute in the face of the solid evidence collected by the Chinese institution. What exactly is the US hiding from the world?The US has long been known as the empire of hacking and champion of secret theft. With its absolute dominance in the field of Internet technology, the US has exercised indiscriminate cyber control and theft on a global scale to benefit itself politically, militarily, diplomatically and commercially. The US’s bullying practices in cyberspace have become a growing concern shared across the international community.There is ample evidence that the US is no doubt the greatest threat to global cyber security. We call on countries to unite, stand up to the US’s hegemonic act which damaged cyber sovereignty and international rules and work together to create a peaceful, secure, open and cooperative cyberspace.Reuters: A group of US lawmakers including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Senator John Cornyn on Tuesday called on US President Joe Biden to issue an executive order on outbound investments to China and other countries. This could give the US government sweeping new powers to block billions of dollars worth of US investment in China. Does the foreign ministry have any comment?Wang Wenbin: In recent years, the US has been using national security as a catch-all pretext to ramp up unjustified investment review. This has created difficulties and obstacles for foreign companies to engage in normal trade and investment cooperation, undermined international economic and trade order and trading rules and threatened the stability of global industrial and supply chains. What the politicians have been doing will only wall the US off, hurting itself and others alike.Reuters: According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, regarding the possibility of a North Korean nuclear test in the near future, South Korea’s spy agency said that if it does indeed take place, it would likely occur between October and November. So I was wondering if the foreign ministry has any comment on this?Wang Wenbin: China’s position on the Korean Peninsula issue remains unchanged. We hope relevant parties will follow the dual-track approach and the principle of phased and synchronized steps and seek a solution that accommodates all parties’ concerns in a balanced manner. The US needs to respond to the DPRK’s concerns with real actions at once and create conditions for the resumption of meaningful dialogue.
9.29 AFP: According to Pakistani police, a Chinese national was shot dead in Karachi. Could you offer any information of the suspect? Does he have any connection with Baloch separatists?Wang Wenbin: We express condolences for the victim and sympathies to the injured. To my knowledge, the victim you mentioned was not a Chinese citizen.CCTV: Today is the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste designated by the UN. Can you talk about China’s measures, achievements and contribution in reducing food waste?Wang Wenbin: To quote an ancient Chinese adage, “Among governing priorities, food comes first.” Ensuring food supply has always been the top governing priority in China. For the Chinese government, reducing food loss and waste is an important pathway towards food security. President Xi Jinping personally advocated the “Clean Plate” initiative to foster strong social awareness of cherishing food and ending waste. China has enhanced regulatory and institutional functions, including adopting the Law on Food Waste, to provide rules for consumers and the catering industry. China has upgraded the infrastructure and equipment for grain production, built more than 60 million hectares of high-quality, well-equipped farmland with high and stable yield, and reduced the mechanical loss of grain harvest by optimizing agricultural machinery and equipment, which enabled China to reduce the waste of wheat harvested in summer this year by 1.25 billion kilograms. China has promoted advanced and applicable technologies including pest control, green storage and moderate processing of bulk grain and oil. The grain loss rate from diseases and pests is kept under five percent. China has actively engaged in international cooperation in reducing food loss and waste. We held the International Conference on Food Loss and Waste in September last year, which was attended by more than 50 countries and international organizations. The Jinan Initiative of the International Food Loss Conference was issued as part of the effort to build international consensus on this front. China listed food security as one of the eight priority areas of cooperation in the Global Development Initiative it proposed, and is working with all parties to proceed with relevant practical cooperation and measures. China has also put forward an initiative on international food security cooperation at the G20, offering China’s solution for the global food security challenge.Food conservation and food loss reduction is a common task of the international community that requires joint efforts of all countries. According to the latest statistics of the World Food Program, 345 million people are facing acute food insecurity in 82 countries. UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that 1.6 billion people cannot be sure of getting enough to eat and nearly 250 million are on the brink of famine. Under the impact of COVID-19, climate change and geopolitical conflicts, the world is undergoing mounting pressure of food shortage and low-income countries are struggling with hunger.The way food waste is dealt with in some developed countries, however, has been regrettable. Their per capita food waste ranks among the top in the world, mainly caused by consumption patterns. The waste of resources and environmental pollution in these countries as a result of overproduction is even more shocking.China is ready to share experience with all parties, actively advance the Global Development Initiative, engage in international cooperation on reducing food loss and waste and jointly uphold global food security. We once again urge developed countries to fulfill their international obligations. We can all contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the goals of Zero Hunger and No Poverty by minimizing food loss and waste.People’s Daily: We have noted that the BRICS cooperation mechanism held a series of meetings in September, including meetings of tourism ministers and energy ministers. Can you share more information?Wang Wenbin: China is the BRICS chair for 2022. Since the beginning of this year, China has fulfilled its duty as the BRICS chair in real earnest and made every effort to advance BRICS cooperation across the board. We have so far successfully held nearly 130 meetings and events. In September alone, we held a number of ministerial meetings, including the meetings of tourism ministers, energy ministers and disaster management ministers.In the meantime, China has vigorously promoted the development of BRICS partnership, deepened the “BRICS Plus” cooperation model, and encouraged more developing countries to participate in BRICS cooperation. So far, China has hosted more than 20 “BRICS Plus” events, including high-level meetings of foreign ministers, trade ministers and health ministers, as well as events in such sectors as poverty alleviation, industrial Internet and digital manufacturing, and think-tanks and civil society organizations. The “BRICS Plus” cooperation model provides a new cooperation platform for emerging markets and developing countries and helps promote solidarity and cooperation among developing countries. It has been fully recognized by BRICS member states and other developing countries.In the rest of the year, China will host more than 30 BRICS meetings and events. We are ready to work with other BRICS members to implement the outcomes and consensus reached at the 14th BRICS Summit in June, make unremitting efforts to deepen solidarity and cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries, and bring more stability and positive energy to world peace and development.Xinhua News Agency: Recently tensions between Palestine and Israel have risen with recurring clashes in East Jerusalem, especially around the al-Aqsa mosque. Do you have any comment?Wang Wenbin: China is deeply concerned about the heightened tensions in Jerusalem. We oppose any action to unilaterally alter the historical status quo of Jerusalem and call on relevant parties, notably Israel, to stay calm and exercise restraint in order to prevent the situation from getting out of control.The root cause of the recurrence of Palestine-Israel conflict lies in the long absence of the implementation of the two-state solution. The international community needs to act with a stronger sense of urgency and facilitate the early resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel on the basis of the two-state solution so that peace could prevail as early as possible between the two sides.Yonhap News Agency: Today marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of relations between China and Japan. What’s your comment?Wang Wenbin: Today marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations. President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have both exchanged congratulatory messages with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Leaders of both countries commented positively on the major historic significance of the normalization of ties and the achievements of bilateral ties over the past 50 years, and envisioned the way forward for China-Japan ties.The 50th anniversary is an important milestone in the course of China-Japan relations. Half a century ago, with extraordinary strategic vision and political courage, the then Chinese and Japanese leaders made the political decision of normalizing ties and opened a new chapter in bilateral relations. Over the past five decades, the two sides have concluded four political documents and reached a series of important common understandings, laying the political and legal foundation for bilateral relations. Exchange and cooperation in various sectors have come a long way, which not only delivered important benefits to both peoples, but also contributed to regional and global peace, stability, development and prosperity.Our world is going through major changes unseen in a century. As bilateral relations embark on the next 50-year journey, both sides need to follow the guidance of the important common understandings between our leaders, adhere to the principles established in the four political documents, renew the original aspiration behind the normalization of ties, stay committed to peace and friendship, expand mutually-beneficial cooperation, manage differences well, and work together to build a China-Japan relationship that meets the call of the new era.
9.30 CCTV: In the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)’s Global Innovation Index 2022 released on September 29, China ranks the 11th, up by one place compared to last year. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: Actually, China’s ranking in the Global Innovation Index has gone up steadily for 10 consecutive years. It moved up by 23 places within 10 years from the 34th in 2012 to the 11th in 2022. This is the latest example of “China speed” and a reflection of China’s achievement in intellectual property (IP) protection.China attaches great importance to scientific and technological innovation, actively integrates itself into the global innovation network, and strictly protects IP rights. China has blazed a path of IP development with Chinese characteristics. From 2012 to 2021, China’s research and development (R&D) spending increased from 1.03 trillion yuan to 2.79 trillion yuan, with the ratio of total national R&D expenditures to GDP jumping from 1.91% to 2.44%. The full-time equivalent of R&D personnel in China has exceeded five million person-years, ranking first in the world for years running. Public satisfaction over China’s IP protection hit a record-high score of 80.61 out of 100, up from 63.69.Scientific and technological innovation is a powerful driving force for the development and progress of human society. No country can become an innovation hub all by itself or keep all the outcomes of innovation to itself. China is not only an important participant in cutting-edge innovation globally, but also an important contributor to joint efforts to solve global issues. In May this year, agreements including the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs entered into force in China, marking China’s accession to almost all major international IP conventions. The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Shanghai Service was established to further strengthen exchanges and cooperation in cross-border IP dispute settlement.China will continue to step up cooperation with countries in scientific and technological innovation with more openness, take an active part in global IP governance, and make greater contribution to the balanced, inclusive and sustainable development of global IP protection.AFP: President Biden announced to provide more than $800 million for the Pacific Islands and said that the security of the US and the world depends on the security of the Pacific Islands. What’s China’s comment?Mao Ning: We have noted that President Biden attended the US-Pacific Island Country Summit and that the US expressed its desire to enhance its presence in the region. I would like to emphasize China’s openness to the increase of normal exchange and cooperation between Pacific Island Countries (PICs) and countries interested in doing so. That being said, PICs must not be viewed as chess pieces in any contest between major powers. We hope the US will genuinely support PICs in responding to climate change and realizing development and revitalization, instead of engaging in geopolitical jostling in the name of cooperation, still less introducing bloc confrontation to the Pacific Islands region.Bloomberg: Just related to that earlier question. Given that China hasn’t managed to arrive at a similar agreement with the Pacific Island Countries, can we expect the doubling of China’s efforts to engage with the region now that the US has signed this initiative with the countries and made this pledge to the countries in the Pacific?Mao Ning: China attaches high importance to developing relations with PICs. We always adhere to the principle that all countries, regardless of size, are all equal. We fully respect the sovereignty and will of PICs. Our cooperation is open, transparent and above-board with no political strings attached. We never impose our will on others or target any third party. Our cooperation has been warmly welcomed by PICs and can stand the test of time and history. We will not engage in geopolitical jostling in the name of cooperation.Shenzhen TV: According to reports, the 20,000th sea-rail intermodal train of the new western land-sea corridor arrived at Tuanjiecun Station in Chongqing not long ago carrying cargo including Vietnamese trunkings and calcium carbonate. Could you offer more information on the cross-border cooperation under this corridor?Mao Ning: The new western land-sea corridor is an important artery, which covers all the provinces, autonomous regions and municipality in western China and connects ASEAN and the Eurasian continent. It is an important economic corridor for China-ASEAN trade.Since the running of the first sea-rail intermodal train of the new western land-sea corridor, the number of trips by this train service has risen at an accelerated pace. The service ran its first 10,000 trips over a period of 1,461 days and it took the service only 487 days for its second 10,000 trips. During the first half of this year, 2,705 trips were made, transporting 269,000 TEUs of goods, a year-on-year increase of 112% and 319% respectively. Today, this corridor goes through 111 stations in 59 cities of 16 Chinese provinces. It connects seamlessly with the China-Europe Railway Express and reaches 335 ports in 113 countries and regions around the world. Its cargo variety has increased from several dozens in the beginning to 640 categories today. The corridor has significantly improved the efficiency and reduced the cost of international logistics, which benefits China, ASEAN and other RCEP members.The new western land-sea corridor provides a new engine for Belt and Road cooperation. It is a vivid illustration of China’s commitment to higher level of opening-up. We believe this corridor, which signifies openness, cooperation and common development, will continue to bring more development opportunities for China and other regional countries.Reuters: Just to circle back on this summit the US held with the Pacific Island Countries. After the conclusion of the summit, President Biden said on Thursday that the US will work harder to satisfy the needs of Pacific Island Countries. He did not mention China in his remarks on Thursday, but during the summit, the US did release a paper detailing its vision for US ties with Pacific Island Countries. And it did say in that paper that one of the challenges facing the region was pressure and economic coercion from China. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this?Mao Ning: China never engages in economic coercion. In developing relations with PICs, China always adheres to the principle that all countries, big or small, are equal. We fully respect the sovereignty and will of PICs. We never attach any political strings or impose our will on anyone. We firmly reject the US’s vilification and denigration.Beijing Youth Daily: According to reports, Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari took an interview with Foreign Policy on September 27. In response to a comment that “China hasn’t quite come to Pakistan’s aid in a big way this year” when the floods hit, he said “that’s absolutely incorrect”. He added that “As far as helping Pakistan, China has helped Pakistan whenever we have been in difficult times... Lifesaving decisions for our economy were made first and foremost by China as far as our floods are concerned—not only the immediate aid relief but also as far as our loan payments are concerned.” Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: We’ve noted the remarks by Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. They reflect the strong friendship and deep mutual trust between China and Pakistan, which define our relations. China and Pakistan are neighbors connected by mountains and rivers. Our futures are linked together. From the devastating floods in 2010 to the locust attack in 2021 in Pakistan, and from the 2008 Wenchuan mega-earthquake to this year’s Luding earthquake in Sichuan province, China and Pakistan have always stood together and come to each other’s aid. China has always been among the first to give Pakistan our full support when the country is confronted either by natural disasters or economic and financial challenges.There are two things worth noting about China’s assistance to Pakistan in the wake of the recent floods. One is the notable speed, scale and intensity of our assistance. The Chinese government decided to provide 400 million yuan worth of humanitarian assistance to Pakistan. China promptly collected all the supply reserves stored under the social and livelihood cooperation framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and delivered them to Pakistan for disaster relief. We provided emergency cash assistance to Pakistan, shared real-time weather forecast and quickly delivered urgently needed supplies such as tents and vegetables to Pakistan through air, land and sea transportation. The other is that our assistance has been a whole-of-government, whole-of-society and all-dimensional effort. A total of 125 million yuan worth of donations and flood-relief supplies have been raised by friendly sub-national governments, companies and charitable individuals. China’s civilian rescue teams have volunteered to assist in Pakistan, and even primary school students have donated their pocket money. China and Pakistan are truly brothers who share weal and woe and form a community with a shared future. China-Pakistan friendship is vibrant and deeply rooted in the hearts of the two peoples.At present, China and Pakistan are in close communication on the delivery of relief supplies into the hands of the people in need and post-disaster reconstruction. China will continue to stand firmly with Pakistan and cherish our iron-clad friendship as we address risks and challenges together. We also have full confidence that the Pakistani government and people will prevail over the floods and rebuild their homes soon.Bloomberg: Two US lawmakers are calling on the State Department to save documents that are linked to what they call the “confinement” of more than a dozen American diplomats in China during COVID-19. These Republican lawmakers are saying that China’s “confinement” of American diplomats could potentially constitute a national security concern. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this?Mao Ning: I assume what you call “confinement” is in fact the quarantine measures designed to stave off COVID-19. Let me stress that China’s COVID containment methods are science-based and effective. They are applied to Chinese and foreign nationals coming to China alike. Our COVID policy is based on openness and transparency. All regular US travelers, US officials paying short-term visits, and personnel of the US embassy and consulates in China have come to China after having learned about and accepted China’s COVID measures including pre-departure protocols and post-entry medical observation and health monitoring. They experienced no such thing as “confinement”.The remarks and narrative of the US lawmakers are simply far-fetched and groundless. They reflect the deeply flawed perception that some US lawmakers have of China and a severe degree of “China-phobia”.Reuters: The US on Thursday imposed sanctions on companies it accused of involvement in Iran’s petrochemical and petroleum trade. This includes companies based in China. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this?Mao Ning: China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the US. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law. This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected. The US side needs to abandon the wrong practice of resorting to sanctions at every turn and do more things that are conducive to negotiations on resuming compliance with the JCPOA.NHK: Russian President Vladimir Putin will unilaterally announce today the annexation of the four Ukrainian regions into Russia. However, UN Secretary-General Guterres has strongly condemned these unilateral actions. China always says that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected, the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed, and efforts should be made to uphold the UN-centered international system. How does China see the acts of Russia?Mao Ning: China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. We believe that all countries deserve respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity, that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed, that the legitimate security concerns of any country should be taken seriously, and that support should be given to all efforts that are conducive to peacefully resolving the crisis. We hope the parties concerned will properly address differences through dialogue and consultation. China stands ready to work with members of the international community to continue to play a constructive part in deescalation efforts.Yonhap News Agency: According to reports, the DPRK fired two ballistic missiles off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula on September 29, the third such activity after previous ones on September 25 and 28. What’s China’s comment?Mao Ning: We have noted relevant foreign media reports. We have also noted that the US and others have conducted multiple joint military exercises in this region recently. The crux of the current situation on the Korean Peninsula is that the legitimate and reasonable security concerns of the DPRK have not been duly responded to. We hope that all parties concerned on the issue of the Korean Peninsula will keep to the direction of seeking political settlement and address each other’s concerns in a balanced way through dialogue and consultation.Nikkei: The provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops between China and the Vatican will expire soon. Will it be extended? Are the two sides in communication over this?Mao Ning: Since China and the Vatican signed the provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops, the agreement has been successfully implemented thanks to the efforts of both sides. The two sides will continue with the relevant work in accordance with the agreed agenda.***In observance of the National Day Holiday, the MFA regular press conference will be adjourned from October 3 (Monday) to October 7 (Friday) and resumed on October 8 (Saturday). During the recess, you can reach the Spokesperson’s Office by fax, email or WeChat.Happy National Day Holiday!
9.7 Xinhua News Agency: Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov talked about his understanding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in a recent interview. He said, "If a party is driven by selfless goals, striving for the common good, prosperity, well-being of the people, then such a party will always be supported by its people." The President also spoke highly of the development of relations between Kyrgyzstan and China since the establishment of diplomatic ties 30 years ago. He also expressed readiness to advance cooperation with China in such fields as green development, innovation and digital economy. Do you have any response to these remarks?Mao Ning: As you quoted, President Zhaparov said in his interview that a party striving for the well-being of the people will always be supported by its people. This is very true. A Harvard University survey among the Chinese people spanning over a decade found that more than 90 percent of respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government. In 2021, as many as 91 percent of Chinese interviewed by Edelman, a top global public relations consultancy firm, said they trust their government, the highest recorded all over the world for years running. These numbers fully support President Zhaparov’s observation. The CPC has the overwhelming support of the people because it puts the people front and center and because it is firmly committed to pursuing happiness for the people and rejuvenation for the nation.I also noted that in the interview, President Zhaparov mentioned China-Kyrgyzstan Belt and Road cooperation and spoke highly of the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping. I can share with you that China-Kyrgyzstan Belt and Road cooperation has produced many important outcomes. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway, the new North-South highway and other connectivity projects have boosted the economic development of Kyrgyzstan and become roads of prosperity, affluence and happiness for the local people.China fully echoes President Zhaparov’s comments on China-Kyrgyzstan relations. China and Kyrgyzstan are truly good neighbors, good friends, good partners and good brothers. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 30 years ago, China and Kyrgyzstan have made new breakthroughs in bilateral relations, enjoyed productive practical cooperation and further upgraded our traditional friendship under the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborliness, friendship, mutual assistance, and win-win cooperation. We are glad to note that under the leadership of President Zhaparov, Kyrgyzstan has enjoyed political stability, economic development and social prosperity. China is ready to work with Kyrgyzstan to exchange experience on state governance, further tap the potential for cooperation, foster new highlights of cooperation, move forward hand in hand on the path of common development, and create an even better future for China-Kyrgyzstan relations.Bloomberg: I have two questions regarding the television interview with the Chinese Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian, who gave an interview with ABC Australia yesterday. The first one is that the Ambassador said that he’d welcome a meeting between the Chinese and Australian leaders under the right conditions. So my question to the foreign ministry is what are those conditions? What constitutes the right conditions? My second question in relation to the same interview is that the Ambassador said that the CPC has broad support in China. What is the metric for showing that?Mao Ning: On your first question, the sound and steady development of China-Australia relations is in the shared interest of both countries and peoples and conducive to peace, stability, development and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. China stands ready to follow the principle of mutual respect and mutual benefit and work with Australia to steadily advance bilateral relations along the track of comprehensive strategic partnership and bring benefits to the two peoples. As for a meeting between the leaders, I have nothing to share.On your second question, in my reply to the previous journalist’s question, I mentioned some figures from surveys conducted by institutions in the West, which found that more than 90 percent of Chinese respondents are satisfied with the Party and their government. In 2021, as many as 91 percent of Chinese interviewed said they trust their government. This is rarely seen in the world and fully shows that the CPC has the broad support of the Chinese people.Kyodo News: The Japanese government will hold a state funeral for former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on September 27. Will China send a representative to attend the funeral? If so, who?Mao Ning: I have nothing to share on this question.AFP: It’s actually a follow-up question on the question that Bloomberg just raised. There has been new comments today by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese who said that he would welcome a meeting with the Chinese leader. What’s your opinion on these comments and is a meeting between the two leaders possible in the next few months?Mao Ning: China values its relations with Australia and is ready to work with Australia to steadily advance bilateral relations along the track of comprehensive strategic partnership. As for the specific question you mentioned, I have no information to offer.AFP: The Russian Ambassador to China just announced that Russian President Putin will meet with the Chinese leader on the margins of the SCO Summit in Samarkand. Can you confirm this?Mao Ning: The Chinese and Russian heads of state have maintained close exchange through various means. Regarding the specific question you raised, I have nothing to share at this moment.Beijing Youth Daily: It is reported that the US Department of Defense released a new space policy document which recognized space as a “priority domain of national military power” and vowed to enhance the US’s space capabilities to defend against “hostile” use of space. The policy paper also said the US will step up military cooperation with allies to jointly promote “norms of behavior for responsible space activities” and provide a durable strategic advantage for the US and its allies. Do you have any comment?Mao Ning: For a long time, the US has openly defined space as a war-fighting domain. It has built the US Space Force and Space Command, developed and deployed space-based offensive weapons, conducted offensive and defensive military exercises and technology tests, and intensified military cooperation with its allies. All this has heightened the risks of military miscalculation and conflict. Also, the US has been stonewalling China and Russia’s space arms control initiative and obstructing negotiation for a legal instrument on arms control in space. In 2017, due to the sole opposition of the US, the UN Group of Governmental Experts on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space was unable to conclude a report.The new document on space policy released by the US Department of Defense recognizes space as a priority domain of national military power, further aggravating the trend of turning outer space into a weapon and a battlefield. It poses a grave challenge to the peace and security of outer space, blatantly tramples on the international consensus on peaceful use of outer space, and fully exposes the US ambition of increasing military build-up and war preparedness and seeking dominance in outer space. The US is in no position whatsoever to talk about so-called “norms of behavior for responsible space activities”.The US should respect the shared concerns of the international community, immediately stop the negative moves that could undermine security of outer space, step up to its due responsibilities and stop hindering negotiations for a legal instrument on arms control in outer space.Shenzhen TV: We noted that German chemical giant BASF held a ceremony yesterday to mark the full construction of its Zhanjiang Verbund site in Guangdong and the inauguration of its first plant of the site. What’s your comment?Mao Ning: Yesterday, a ceremony was held by BASF to inaugurate its Zhanjiang Verbund site in Guangdong. The ceremony was attended by Han Zheng, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council. With a total investment of about 10 billion euros, the site is the largest single investment project by a German enterprise in China. The inauguration of the project is of important significance for deepening China-Germany trade and investment cooperation and for the two countries’ efforts to jointly address the impact of COVID-19 and keep the industrial and supply chains of the global petrochemical industry secure and stable.The continued growth of German investment in China since the beginning of this year is evidence that German businesses are optimistic about China’s economic prospects and business environment and fully confident in investing and operating in China.China stands ready to work with all countries to enhance economic, trade and investment cooperation and grow an open world economy.The Paper: Deputy Spokesperson of the US State Department Vedant Patel said during a press briefing on September 6 that the US’s latest arms sales to Taiwan are for defensive purposes and there is no reason for China to react. Do you have any comment on this?Mao Ning: China has always been unequivocally against the US’s military contact with Taiwan and arms sales to Taiwan. Taiwan is a province of China. There is no such thing as “defense for Taiwan”. US arms sales to China’s Taiwan region violate the US’s political commitment in the three China-US joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué. By selling arms to Taiwan, the US is supporting and conniving at “Taiwan independence” and creating new factors that could lead to tensions in the Taiwan Strait. The US side needs to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués and stop using Taiwan against China. China will act resolutely in response to acts that undermine China’s sovereignty and security and interfere in China’s internal affairs.Hubei Media Group: The earthquake that recently struck Luding County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province has caught international attention and many countries have expressed sympathies to China. What is the foreign ministry’s comment on this?Mao Ning: Since the earthquake hit Luding, Sichuan on September 5, Russia and many other countries have extended their sympathies to China through various means, and expressed readiness to offer support and assistance for quake relief. We truly appreciate their gesture.The Chinese government is doing everything necessary for the quake relief. Teams specializing in various types of rescue have rushed to the sites. Operations are in full swing to search for the missing, save and treat the injured, look after the affected and urgently restore infrastructure in the quake-stricken areas. We have the confidence to prevail over the disaster and rebuild homes for the local people.
9.8 Reuters: Taiwan said on Thursday that it would send a representative to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state funeral. What is the foreign ministry’s response to this? Can the foreign ministry announce if a representative from China is attending the funeral and if so, who it is?Mao Ning: Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The Taiwan question bears on the political foundation of China-Japan relations and the basic trust between our two countries. The Japanese side has made serious political commitments on this to China for multiple times. The Japanese side should abide by the principles of the four political documents between China and Japan and handle relevant issues in strict accordance with the one-China principle. Japan must not provide any platform for “Taiwan independence” forces to find opportunities for political manipulation.The Taiwan authorities seek to use the event to engage in political manipulation and benefit politically. Their political calculations will not succeed.Regarding your question on whether someone will represent China at the funeral, I gave an answer yesterday and have nothing to share.CCTV: According to reports, Russian President Putin said at the Eastern Economic Forum on September 7 that the system of international relations has undergone irreversible, tectonic shifts. Emerging countries around the world, including in the Asia-Pacific region, now play a substantially bigger role. Sanctions by Western countries, replacing the pandemic, have become the biggest threat to the world. In an attempt to obstruct the course of history, the US has undermined the pillars of the global economic order, including in financial and monetary sectors, built over centuries, and concocted self-serving rules based on its own will. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: As permanent members of the UN Security Council and representatives of major emerging markets, China and Russia have firmly defended the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, resolutely practiced true multilateralism and stayed committed to achieving world economic recovery amid the pandemic. In stark contrast, certain country has disregarded the purposes of the UN Charter and the basic norms of international law and willfully imposed illegal unilateral sanctions against other countries, which has had a serious impact on the world political and economic order and the international governance system.We will continue to work with Russia and the rest of the international community to jointly promote a multi-polar world, economic globalization and greater democracy in international relations, and make positive contributions to building a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.Bloomberg: A bipartisan group of eight US lawmakers arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday, led by Stephanie Murphy, a Representative from Florida. Today, some of the representatives met with Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen. Does the Chinese foreign ministry have a comment on this visit by the US lawmakers to Taiwan?Mao Ning: The US lawmakers’ visit to China’s Taiwan region seriously violates the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-US joint communiqués and goes against the US’s commitment of maintaining only unofficial ties with the Taiwan region. The Chinese side deplores and firmly rejects this.There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. The government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. We will not waver in opposing “Taiwan independence” separatist activities and external interference. We urge the relevant US politicians to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqués, immediately stop all forms of official interactions with Taiwan, and immediately stop sending wrong signals to “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. China will continue to take strong measures to resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.CCTV: The Fourth Forum of Science, Technology and Innovation of China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States was held the other day in a virtual format. More than 20 representatives of science and technology ministries from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) attended the meeting via video link. Representatives of LAC countries expressed the strong desire to promote China-LAC cooperation in such areas as agro-technology, digital economy, and development driven by science and technology. Can you share more information of the forum?Mao Ning: The Forum of Science, Technology and Innovation of China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States is an important sub-forum of the China-CELAC Forum. This forum was co-hosted by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology and Argentina’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of CELAC. The forum was themed on “science and technology for common development, solidarity and cooperation for a better future”. The forum adopted a joint statement. An MOU was signed between China’s Ministry of Science and Technology and the science and technology authorities of the LAC states to advance cooperation on establishing a sustainable food innovation center. The two sides spoke highly of the achievements of bilateral scientific and technological cooperation and agreed to deepen cooperation in clean energy, digital technology, agro-tech, satellite communications and other fields.LAC is a promising land filled with hope and dynamism. Equality, mutual benefit and shared development has always been the hallmark of China-LAC relations. Last year, trade between our two sides exceeded $450 billion for the first time. The two sides hosted the Third Ministers’ Meeting of the China-CELAC Forum, where new broad consensus was reached on deepening our strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation in the following three years. Statistics show that between 2005 and 2020, Latin America saw the construction or inauguration of more than 100 infrastructure projects undertaken by China. Those projects created over 600,000 local jobs. From jointly combating COVID-19 to conducting joint R&D on resources satellites, from ensuring food security to introducing each other’s specialties from the agriculture, husbandry and fishery industries into domestic markets, China-LAC cooperation has proven to be unconstrained by geographical distance and has flourished instead.As fellow members of the developing world, China and LAC countries all advocate a multi-polar world and greater democracy in international relations. The shared aspiration for independence, development and prosperity is a strong bond linking the “Chinese dream” and the “LAC dream”. China stands ready to work together with Latin America to remain committed to the concept of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, advance high-quality BRI cooperation, actively act on the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, and strengthen and expand practical cooperation across the sector to build a China-LAC community with a shared future.Bloomberg: A report came out today from Freedom House in the US which claims that the Chinese government is expanding efforts to increase its media influence around the world. And the report also includes observations that Chinese diplomats are also involved in such activities. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on the report from Freedom House?Mao Ning: The organization you mentioned has a long track record of making false allegations on China-related issues. This report is not fact-based and is driven by ulterior motives.Telling the story of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and presenting a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China to the world is part and parcel of the job of Chinese media and foreign service. What we share with the world are facts, real numbers, concrete examples and plain truth. They are completely different from the so-called “influence efforts” or “disinformation” in the report.I would also like to point out that the criteria for evaluating a media outlet should not be based on a country’s political system or ideology, but whether the reporting itself is objective, truthful, fair and just. Chinese media abide by press ethics and uphold the principles of objectivity, integrity, truthfulness and faithfulness. The report you mentioned pins labels on the normal reporting activities of the Chinese media on the grounds of their so-called affiliation, while turning a blind eye to the false reporting of some Western media. This is typical double standard.We will continue to tell the world the story of China, the story of the CPC and the story of China’s pursuit of peaceful development, and work to build deeper mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world.
9.9 CCTV: President Xi Jinping exchanged congratulatory messages today with the rotating Chairperson of the African Union and Senegalese President Macky Sall on the 20th anniversary of the AU’s founding and the establishment of China-AU diplomatic relations. How does the foreign ministry view this special day and special year?Mao Ning: As you said, this is a special day. Today is the African Union Day. President Xi Jinping exchanged congratulatory messages today with the rotating Chairperson of the African Union (AU) and Senegalese President Macky Sall on the 20th anniversary of the AU’s founding and the establishment of China-AU diplomatic relations. This is the first time the two sides have done so in the history of China-Africa relations. It demonstrates China and Africa’s long-standing and time-tested friendship, solidarity and cooperation that is growing ever stronger, and firm determination to build a China-Africa community with a shared future in the new era.This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the AU and the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the AU. Over the past two decades, the AU has led African countries in seeking strength through unity and pursuing development, revitalization and integration. Africa has shown its strength in fighting COVID-19, upholding multilateralism and safeguarding the common interests of developing countries. China congratulates and commends Africa for what it has achieved. Over the past two decades, China-AU relations have stood the test of changing international circumstances and engaged in fruitful cooperation. Our ties play a guiding role in carrying forward China-Africa friendship, deepening South-South cooperation and building a community with a shared future for mankind. This is truly gratifying and encouraging.China attaches great importance to developing relations with the AU, and takes the AU as an important partner for promoting China-Africa friendship and cooperation as well as solidarity and cooperation among developing countries. We firmly support the AU in playing a bigger role in African and international affairs. China is ready to work with the AU rotating Chairperson and Senegalese President Macky Sall, Chairperson of the AU Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat and other AU leaders to further strengthen communication and coordination, deepen political mutual trust, expand practical cooperation, and firmly support each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests and major concerns, so as to jointly bring China-AU and China-Africa relations to a higher level.TASS: British Queen Elizabeth II died Thursday in her summer residence in Scotland at age 96. Do you have any comment about this?Mao Ning: We deeply mourn the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. President Xi Jinping has sent a message of condolences to King Charles III. Premier Li Keqiang has sent a message of condolences to Prime Minister Liz Truss.Throughout her seven-decade reign, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II devoted herself to advancing national development and the UK’s friendly exchanges with the rest of the world. She was the first British sovereign to visit China. She received multiple Chinese leaders on their visits to the UK and made important contribution to enhancing our two peoples’ mutual understanding and expanding our two countries’ friendly exchanges. We will continue to work with the British Royal Family and various sectors of the UK to advance our bilateral relations.Asahi Shimbun: The DPRK has promulgated a new legislation on its nuclear arms. China has always been committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. What is China's comment on this latest move of the DPRK?Mao Ning: We’ve noted this development. China’s position on the Korean Peninsula issue remains unchanged. We will bear in mind the larger interest of upholding peace and stability on the Peninsula and continue to play a positive role in promoting the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.China News Service: On September 8, Angola’s Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint filed by the opposition and verified the election results released by the National Electoral Commission, according to reports. The People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the ruling party, won the election with 51.17% of the votes, and Joao Lourenco was reelected as the President. What is China’s comment?Mao Ning: We commend the smooth running of the general elections in Angola and express our congratulations to President Lourenco on his reelection. In recent years, China and Angola have strengthened strategic partnership and advanced practical cooperation. China highly values the development of China-Angola relations, and stands ready to continue to work with Angola for more productive friendly cooperation.The Hindu: India and China’s defense ministries, in a joint statement, have said they’ve begun the process of disengagement in the area of Jianan Daban, which is another step toward resolving the standoff in eastern Ladakh. Can you share details? And also what does this agreement mean for the rest of the disengagement process on the line of actual control?Mao Ning: According to the consensus reached in the 16th Round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting, the Chinese and Indian troops in the area of Jianan Daban began to disengage on September 8. This is the outcome of multiple rounds of talks over a period of time between the two sides’ diplomatic and military establishments at various levels. It is conducive to peace and tranquility in the border areas.If you would like to know more details, let me refer you to the readout released by China’s Ministry of National Defense after the 16th Round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting. As to the early resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest, the two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views at the 16th round of meeting. Both sides reiterated that resolving the remaining issues will help restore peace and tranquility along the LAC in the Western Sector and promote the development of bilateral relations.Xinhua News Agency: The 158th meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the League of Arab States (LAS) on September 6 and 7 adopted a resolution on Arab-China relations which reiterated the Arab states’ support for the one-China principle, their readiness to strengthen cooperation with China in various fields under the Belt and Road Initiative, and their appreciation of China’s diplomatic effort in supporting the Arab cause, advancing the peaceful settlement of regional crisis, and promoting international and regional peace and security. What is your comment?Mao Ning: China highly appreciates the annual adoption of the resolution on strengthening relations with China by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the League of Arab States (LAS) for years running. This fully demonstrates the firm determination of Arab states to develop relations with China and reflects the profound traditional friendship and solid strategic partnership between China and Arab states.China and Arab states are future-oriented strategic partners of comprehensive cooperation and common development. We have always firmly supported each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests and major concerns. After US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the provocative visit to China’s Taiwan region in August, the LAS Secretariat immediately issued a statement stressing its firm commitment to the one-China principle. Our two sides enjoy fruitful cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. China has been the largest trading partner of Arab states for many years. Our practical cooperation in various fields has continued to deepen and become a fine example of South-South cooperation. The two sides have maintained close coordination on hotspot issues in the Middle East and jointly contributed to regional peace and development.China will continue to firmly support Arab states in addressing regional security issues through solidarity and coordination, and support people in Arab states in independently exploring their development paths. We will continue to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Arab states, actively conduct Belt and Road cooperation, implement the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, and jointly build a community with a shared future for China and Arab states in the new era.Macau Monthly: The third China-Arab Reform and Development Forum was held yesterday. Could you share more information on it?Mao Ning: Thank you for your interest in this event. Yesterday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs held the third China-Arab Reform and Development Forum in virtual format with the help of the China-Arab Research Center on Reform and Development. Zhai Jun, Special Envoy of the Chinese Government for the Middle East, attended the opening ceremony of the forum. Experts and academics from China and a dozen Arab countries including Egypt, the UAE and Saudi Arabia attended the event. This is the third gathering of the forum. The previous two gatherings were held in 2018 and 2019 respectively. This forum focuses on the Global Development Initiative (GDI). Participants held in-depth exchanges and discussions on building greater synergy between development strategies and jointly advancing the GDI and realizing robust, green and sound development through innovation, and explored ideas for promoting shared development.Throughout the forum, we could feel that the Arab countries identify with and support the GDI and they have responded warmly to it. Arab experts said at the forum that the GDI could help send the issue of development back to the top of the international agenda. It is in line with Arab countries’ pressing need for development, peace and reform and the shared aspiration of China and Arab countries to deepen cooperation in pursuit of common development. Arab experts welcome the 32 concrete measures China announced at the High-level Dialogue on Global Development, which, they believe, demonstrate China’s sense of responsibility as a major country in implementing the GDI with real actions and promoting post-COVID economic recovery, and will provide fresh impetus for China-Arab development cooperation.To advance the implementation of the GDI in the Arab world, Arab experts put forward many suggestions. For example, they proposed that China and Arab countries seek greater synergy between development strategies and promote practical cooperation in such fields as scientific and technological innovation, food security, desert control, seawater desalination, climate change, vaccine R&D, digital economy and poverty alleviation. We stand ready to work together with Arab countries to accelerate implementation of the GDI, build consensus and pool strength from both sides, and jointly contribute to forging a China-Arab community with a shared future.Prasar Bharati: Yesterday’s joint statement mentioned that the disengagement process has started. Once this is completed, will China proceed with India towards complete disengagement, de-escalation and de-induction at the LAC at Ladakh border?Mao Ning: China has consistently carried out normal activities in the border areas in accordance with the relevant agreements signed between China and India. We have been asking the Indian side to also follow relevant agreements.Prasar Bharati: Do you think after this particular disengagement, will it be a status quo restoration of April 2020?Mao Ning: I’d like to state that the status quo of April 2020 you mentioned was created by India’s illegal crossing of the LAC. China will by no means accept that.Prasar Bharati: As you said, it was illegal trespassing of India. So do you mean to say that China has accepted that illegal trespassing by India and now it’s saying that we should move bilateral relations forward without resolving the border standoff?Mao Ning: The fact that China and India agreed to begin disengagement in the area of Jianan Daban is a positive development that is conducive to peace and tranquility along the border. China is committed to properly handling relevant issues through communication and dialogue. We don’t accept the so-called status quo created by India’s illegal crossing of the LAC, but that doesn’t mean we don’t attach importance to peace and tranquility along the border. The two sides have all along maintained communication over this through diplomatic and military channels.Reuters: A question about a report our news agency put out yesterday night. So sources told Reuters that Germany’s economy ministry is considering a series of measures to make business with China less attractive. These measures could include reducing or even scrapping investment and export guarantees for China and no longer promoting trade fairs and manager training in China, our sources told us. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on this report and whether it is concerned about Germany-China economic cooperation?Mao Ning: I’m not aware of what you mentioned. If what was reported is true, then I have to say the measures to be taken by Germany are simply illogical and make no sense. They would not bring any good to Germany’s own economy or practical cooperation with China. Over the past 50 years, China and Germany have advanced economic and trade cooperation in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. Bilateral trade and investment continued to grow in the first seven months this year against the odds. Such close economic links came into shape as a result of both the law of the market and the choices of businesses. They also epitomize economic globalization.What I want to tell you is that no matter how the international landscape may evolve, China will not change its determination to pursue high-level opening-up, share development opportunities with the world, and contribute to an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. I also believe that China will become an even more attractive market for foreign investment. We hope that Germany will adopt a rational and practical policy toward China and support greater two-way opening-up to inject positive energy into the high-level mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries and help build an open world economy, instead of shooting itself in the foot.PTI: You said India violated the status quo in April 2020. Can you please tell us how, because India was not having troops of that magnitude in that area at the particular time?Mao Ning: First of all, this is not the first time China has stated its position on this issue. Secondly, China and India hold different positions on the border issues. But what is most important now is for both sides to keep up communication and dialogue, make the disengagement a first step and ensure peace and tranquility along the border.PTI: So this particular new agreement between the two countries on disengagement from this particular point. Do you think that this will now restore normalcy between the two countries or at least the two countries can proceed ahead with normalization of relations?Mao Ning: As I just said, the beginning of disengagement is a positive development. We hope this will help facilitate the sound and steady development of bilateral relations.Reuters: Just to follow up on my previous question, one of our sources told us that the German government is considering submitting a complaint to the WTO about what it views as unfair Chinese trade practices along with the G7 group. We were wondering if the foreign ministry had a comment on this specific potential measure.Mao Ning: China always acts in accordance with WTO rules. If Germany lodges the so-called complaint, China will defend its lawful rights and interests under the WTO framework.****************************************************************************************************In observance of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the MFA regular press conference will be adjourned on September 12 (Monday), and resumed on September 13 (Tuesday).
